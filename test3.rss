Just ask yourself:

- Do you just have coffee for breakfast, because a real meal would slow you down?

- Do you eat lunch while you work, instead of taking a break?

- Do you mindlessly scroll before going to bed because your mind is too busy?  

- Do you take on extra work because you think, “I’m the only one who can do this, right?”

- Are you always there for others but don’t take care of yourself? 

These are some of the signs of high-functioning depression you should not ignore.

Joining Mel today is the world’s leading expert and researcher on this topic, Dr. Judith Joseph, MD.

Today, Dr. Joseph is here to share her groundbreaking research on this important subject and exactly what to do to feel more energized, excited, joyful, and present in your life again.

What your metabolism is and what it has to do with your mental and physical health.
The shocking patient results and personal story that fueled Dr. Palmer’s passion.
The 7 signs that you probably have a metabolic disorder.
How the Brain Energy protocol could help your mind and body heal.

What mitochondria are and how they are the key to your mental health.
How the ketogenic diet was discovered as a medical protocol by doctors.
How to know if you’re getting enough sleep.
What exercise has to do with your mental health.
How to help someone in your life who’s struggling with their mental health.
What you need to hear if you’re the one who needs support.

      <itunes:duration>00:48:06</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>Do you want to know the surprising truth about motivation?

Right now, think about something you want to change or improve.

How do you make lasting and powerful changes and life improvements? And how do you keep going even when you don’t have the motivation to do it?

If change was easy, we’d all have six-pack abs and a million dollars in the bank.

And that’s where this episode comes in: Mel is here to teach you the HOW.

In this episode, you’ll learn:

How to self-motivate so you can take action.
What dopamine is and how it’s linked to motivation.
The simple steps you can take today to tap back into your internal drive.
The 2 truths about motivation that you are forgetting.
The research-backed reason you continue, initiate, or quit something.
What to do when someone you love is losing motivation.
The real reason you cannot motivate others.
How to cope with not getting something you have been working towards.
How to navigate feeling “behind” or in a “comparison game”.
How to pick yourself back up when you feel like life’s punched you in the face.
The first (and most important) step in understanding what drives your motivation.
One powerful question to ask yourself when you feel “stuck”.
What role dreams and goals play (and it’s not always to achieve them).
How to hack the moment of hesitation we all feel.
The most powerful reframe you need about failing.
How to get clear about the direction you are going in without wandering aimlessly.
Mel’s 5-second rule that will move you towards action (even when you are not motivated).

This episode comes with a 29-page companion workbook. This workbook is designed using the latest research to help you get clear about what you want and empower you to take the next step forward in your life. And the cool part? It takes less than a minute for you to get your hands on it.

	•	How to stop feeling overwhelmed and heavy in the morning so you can get more done
	•	Why morning routines are boring (according to research) but essential

      <itunes:subtitle>Are you always the one who is late for everything?

Do you find yourself procrastinating, no matter how hard you try to stay focused?

Does managing your time to get everything done feel impossible?

Mel sits down with THE world’s leading researcher on procrastination.

Dr. Joseph Ferrari is a distinguished Professor of Psychology at DePaul University in Chicago, where he has spent nearly three decades researching with colleagues around the world about why we procrastinate. Today, he’s sharing those surprising findings with you.

Topics discussed include:
How research defines procrastination. (It’s not what you think.)
Why procrastination is an epidemic.
How procrastinators see the world.
The difference between someone who procrastinates and a procrastinator.
Signs you may be a chronic procrastinator.
How the Premack Principle helps you get stuff done.
The REAL reason you procrastinate.
Why “social esteem” is so important to procrastinators.
The ONE word that can change how you think about yourself.
A powerful strategy to use when you feel stuck.
The link between procrastination and perfectionism.
The difference between an excuse and a legitimate reason.
How to deal with procrastinators in your life.

      <itunes:summary>Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a way to not get so annoyed or frustrated with the people that you love?

There is. 

It’s called the “Let Them” theory. Mel discovered it while arguing with her son about a taco stand, and she hasn’t stopped using it since.

She first explained the “Let Them” theory in a 60-second reel on Instagram. 63 million views later. The verdict is in. Everyone loves the “let them” theory.

Today, Mel is in the studio, taking your calls live and teaching you 6 ways to improve any relationship with the “Let Them” theory.

In this episode, you hear Mel cover topics like:

How to handle a mother-in-law who is not supportive.
Feeling left out? Good. You need better friends.
Why moving in with your parents is better than living with an ex.
What to say when your sibling wants to gossip about your mom.
Why being the family peacekeeper creates a war inside you.
How to stop being the “fixer” in your relationships.
The truth about addiction in a family and the role you need to play.
Why your dad’s gambling problem isn’t yours to fix.
How rescuing people robs them of the problems they need to face.
What to do when your parents’ marriage is in crisis.
How to tell a friend you are sick of hearing about their relationship drama.
Why you shouldn’t be the “therapist” for your friend group.
Why it&apos;s normal for friends to drop you when you start drawing boundaries.
The art of putting yourself first: “Let me” be happy for a change.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, you are going to learn how to have better sex. You have an appointment with a leading sex expert, Dr. Emily Morse. I will be the first to admit that I want to have better sex, but I don’t know how to achieve it.



And I’m asking all the uncomfortable questions you want to ask.



This conversation is going to make you think differently about this topic and inspire you to prioritize pleasure and connection in bed, no matter your age, relationship status, or gender.



And if you are saying, “This doesn’t apply to me,” or as my friend just said, “I’m in way worse than a drought! At this point, I’m a born-again virgin.&quot;



No, you’re not. And this episode is for you too, because our expert says improving your solo sex life is the first step.



You may not want your little ones to listen because, when it comes to confessions about sex, I&apos;m going first.



Dr. Emily claims that everything you have been taught or observed about sex is WRONG.



Wait. WHAT??...



Dr. Emily is insightful, and this conversation is hilarious and actionable.


You will learn:



The 3 unexpected ways you are killing your sex drive.
How to get out of your head when you’re in bed.
Why meditation and sex might be the combo you need to orgasm.
You are NOT alone if you cannot orgasm from penetration.
How to tell time with your vulva (yes, it is a thing).
Masturbation without shame and secrecy.
Why skipping foreplay is ruining your chance of having great sex.
The 5 ways your self-awareness ignites hot and steamy sex.
Let’s stop faking orgasms. Know the four steps to how you can really get there.



Grab your mirrors and vibrators, and leave your inhibitions and embarrassment at the door. And according to our expert, it’s amazing foreplay to talk about sex. So why don&apos;t you and your partner listen to this together? You’ll thank me later.

Maybe we’ll call these sex episodes “Listen and Lube”?

      <itunes:subtitle>In this episode, you are going to learn how to have better sex. You have an appointment with a leading sex expert, Dr. Emily Morse. I will be the first to admit that I want to have better sex, but I don’t know how to achieve it.



And I’m asking all the uncomfortable questions you want to ask.



This conversation is going to make you think differently about this topic and inspire you to prioritize pleasure and connection in bed, no matter your age, relationship status, or gender.



And if you are saying, “This doesn’t apply to me,” or as my friend just said, “I’m in way worse than a drought! At this point, I’m a born-again virgin.&quot;



No, you’re not. And this episode is for you too, because our expert says improving your solo sex life is the first step.



You may not want your little ones to listen because, when it comes to confessions about sex, I&apos;m going first.



Dr. Emily claims that everything you have been taught or observed about sex is WRONG.



Wait. WHAT??...



Dr. Emily is insightful, and this conversation is hilarious and actionable.


You will learn:



The 3 unexpected ways you are killing your sex drive.
How to get out of your head when you’re in bed.
Why meditation and sex might be the combo you need to orgasm.
You are NOT alone if you cannot orgasm from penetration.
How to tell time with your vulva (yes, it is a thing).
Masturbation without shame and secrecy.
Why skipping foreplay is ruining your chance of having great sex.
The 5 ways your self-awareness ignites hot and steamy sex.
Let’s stop faking orgasms. Know the four steps to how you can really get there.



Grab your mirrors and vibrators, and leave your inhibitions and embarrassment at the door. And according to our expert, it’s amazing foreplay to talk about sex. So why don&apos;t you and your partner listen to this together? You’ll thank me later.

Maybe we’ll call these sex episodes “Listen and Lube”?

      <itunes:summary>In this important and special episode, you will hear the beautiful, profound, and comforting words that are needed in the world right now.



When I woke up this morning, I did not expect to have this conversation.



But, as I watched the news unfold, I felt overwhelmed and hopeless, seeing a world that feels like it’s spinning out of control.



I thought to myself, &quot;If I could talk to one person right now who could give you and me the love, support, and tools that help when you feel scared of the world around you, who would it be?&quot;



I knew exactly who I wanted to talk to: Dr. Thema Bryant.



Dr. Thema Bryant is a scholar, minister, and tenured professor at Pepperdine University. A clinical psychologist who completed her postdoctoral studies at Harvard Medical Center’s Victims of Violence, Dr. Thema Bryant is the current president of the American Psychological Association and has published multiple best-selling books.



Every time I listen to her speak, she radiates so much love, perspective, and soft empowerment to help you face whatever is going on in your life.



I seriously feel my soul exhale whenever she speaks, and that’s why I wanted her to talk to you and me through this difficult time.



Whether you’re watching tragedy play out in the news or things are happening for you globally, nationally, locally, or even in your own living room, this is a conversation that will help you.



You don’t have to be directly impacted by what is going on out there in the world to feel the uneasiness and overwhelm inside you.



Please take 29 minutes and join me and Dr. Thema Bryant for this incredibly powerful message: 



Even when things seem so dark, there is still a light inside of you and me, and there are ways in which you can connect with it, no matter what is happening.



This conversation is packed with meaning and simple things to do if you’re feeling overwhelmed or are in the middle of turmoil within your own community, relationships, or family.



Dr. Thema will guide you in navigating your feelings.



She’ll explain to you with reassurance and wisdom how exactly to process what is going on, while still staying connected with yourself.



If you don’t feel like you have a soft or safe place to land or don’t know how to sort through overwhelming feelings, this conversation will feel like a gift.



Thank you for being here for this and for sharing it with everyone you know and love.



Because everyone is in it right now, and we all need some guidance.

      <itunes:title>Never Enough: 7 Ways to Protect Yourself (and Your Kids) From Toxic Pressure</itunes:title>
      <itunes:author>SiriusXM Podcasts</itunes:author>
      <itunes:duration>00:54:49</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>In this episode, award-winning Harvard-educated journalist and researcher Jenny Wallace is here to discuss “toxic achievement” and the toxic pressure that makes you feel that no matter what you do or what level of success you achieve, it will never be enough.



You feel toxic pressure at work, and you feel toxic pressure at home. Jenny Wallace, who just completed a major research study with over 6,000 kids and their parents, is here to tell you this unhealthy pressure is trickling down to your kids, who are buckling under the never-ending demands to measure up.



Whether you are sick of spending every weekend racing from one sporting event or club team practice to another, or you are tired of the never-ending video calls that keep you working day and night, one thing is clear: something has to give.



Your worth is not determined by the things you achieve.



Jenny Wallace is here with the research and the findings that say all this pressure is backfiring because all anyone really wants is to feel like they matter.



According to her research, there are seven changes you can make that will boost your kids’ confidence and resilience and get you off this hamster wheel that is leading nowhere.



If you struggle with work-life balance and feel burned out, the research will empower you to:



Learn the one question to ask your kid that shows you love them.
Stop working yourself into the ground to prove your worth.
Why you are your harshest critic and the simple things you need to do to become your biggest fan.
Snip the tie between achievement and self-worth.
Unplug yourself from the stress loop of other people and never get rattled again.
The 3 things you can do to show people you love that they matter to you.
Stop beating yourself up for not having the perfect home or getting A’s on every test, and prioritize what really matters instead.



I want you to get off the hamster wheel and stop being obsessed with achieving, having, and winning.



You hold the key to helping yourself and others feel like they matter in this world.



It’s time to unlock it.

I am sitting down with intuitive psychic medium Kim Russo, who is here to share her gift and tell you how you can get in touch with your intuitive gift, too.



I first learned about Kim from Oprah Winfrey and immediately knew I needed to get her on the talk show I hosted. What happened next changed my entire life.



When Kim was just a child, she realized she could see people who’d passed away, and nobody else was seeing them. After years of denying it, she decided to lean into her incredible skill. A skill she says you have too.

Kim has helped MILLIONS tune into their innate intuition by teaching them to quiet their minds and listen to their inner voice to figure out the next step.



Are you skeptical? I was, too.



Until she gave me a message from my dead father-in-law. It is the reason I sold my Boston home after 26 years and moved to southern Vermont. She changed my life forever.



What Kim will teach you is invaluable; you will learn:



What intuition is—and it’s not crazy woo-woo stuff.
Why that little voice in your head is actually right—and you need to listen to it.
The simple but powerful lessons she learned from those who have passed over will make your shoulders relax instantly.
That every soul on this planet has a purpose, and how to find out what yours is.
What the brain-heart connection is and how it instantly gives you the information you need right now.
That you have souls supporting you from the other side, and how to connect with them.





Kim will show you why and how we must open up our minds and hearts to new possibilities and use the guidance of our loved ones to navigate life.



You just have to listen.

      <title>Yes, You Can Make a Difference: This Remarkable Story Will Inspire You to Do Something Big</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In today’s episode, author and entrepreneur Lorenzo Lewis tells you the amazing story of how he is changing the lives of over 3 million people a year.</p><p> </p><p>His story is so inspiring, and I wanted you to meet Lorenzo because I know he’ll inspire you to think bigger about making a difference in your community or the world at large.</p><p> </p><p>Lorenzo had no funding, influence, or experience. He just had a simple idea and a very big heart. And that’s all you need to make the world a better place.</p><p> </p><p>When Lorenzo was born, the odds were already stacked against him: his mother gave birth to him while she was in jail. His father died in prison. He was raised by his aunt and uncle.

      <itunes:duration>01:17:47</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>In today’s episode, author and entrepreneur Lorenzo Lewis tells you the amazing story of how he is changing the lives of over 3 million people a year.



His story is so inspiring, and I wanted you to meet Lorenzo because I know he’ll inspire you to think bigger about making a difference in your community or the world at large.



Lorenzo had no funding, influence, or experience. He just had a simple idea and a very big heart. And that’s all you need to make the world a better place.



When Lorenzo was born, the odds were already stacked against him: his mother gave birth to him while she was in jail. His father died in prison. He was raised by his aunt and uncle. As a child, he struggled with anger, anxiety, and depression and was labeled a problem.



You’ll hear about the defining moment when Lorenzo made the decision to turn his life around. He graduated from college and started working in health and human services. That was where, at the age of 24, he had an idea about creating a mental health movement that is now changing millions of lives.



“The Confess Project” was born. 



Lorenzo’s nonprofit trains barbers and beauticians to be mental health advocates for the men, women, and children who are sitting in their chairs.



Now 3,000 mental health advocates across the country are changing the lives of over 3 million people a year.



It’s an absolutely incredible story.



Today, you will learn:

The incredible solution Lorenzo thought of to make therapy accessible and easy for underserved and represented communities.
How to give yourself permission to pursue that big idea.
The revolutionary Harvard study that explains why you feel so comfortable telling your hairdresser about everything.
Why you have all the power and tools you need to make a difference.
How working from home has increased loneliness (and why you feel like you have nobody to talk to).
The 4 things you can say to someone who is having a bad day (steal this from Lorenzo’s playbook).
Why now is the right time to take action on that project you are thinking about.



I can’t wait for you to meet, learn from, and be inspired by Lorenzo.



His story is proof that it’s never too late to change your own life and that when you see a problem you want to solve, lean into it.



You’ll not only help other people; you’ll surprise yourself with how much of a difference you can make.

      <itunes:summary>In today’s episode, I’m sharing the “6 magic words” that I say to myself on repeat whenever I start to spiral.

I call them “magic” because they seem to have an almost spell-like effect on me when I say them out loud.

I’ve shared these 6 magic words with millions of people online, and today you’re going to learn what they are and how to use them to your advantage.

If you&apos;re a worrier, an overthinker, or struggle with anxiety, you’ll love these 6 words.

You can use them like a tool to stop yourself from worrying, obsessing, catastrophizing, and creating problems in your mind that don’t exist in the present moment.

These 6 words are rooted in behavioral science, psychology, stoicism, and even Buddhism. In fact, I’m going to share a fantastic metaphor to make this even more visual and easy to understand and apply in your life.

You will also learn:

How to use my 6-word phrase to interrupt your worries and self-doubt.
The question you can ask yourself to beat fear with logic.
A beautiful Buddhist teaching that will empower you to stop torturing yourself mentally.
A shocking study about how stressful thoughts cause you real pain.
What “positive ideation” is and why you need to use it the next time you start to spiral.
What the data says about your worries (my jaw was on the floor).
Exactly how to train your brain to be more optimistic.

Bottom line: You have the power to quiet anxious thoughts and to stop the endless loop of worries that run through your head.

You just need the 6 magic words I’m about to teach you right now.

I’ve shared these 6 magic words with millions of people online, and today you’re going to learn what they are and how to use them to your advantage.

If you&apos;re a worrier, an overthinker, or struggle with anxiety, you’ll love these 6 words.

You can use them like a tool to stop yourself from worrying, obsessing, catastrophizing, and creating problems in your mind that don’t exist in the present moment.

These 6 words are rooted in behavioral science, psychology, stoicism, and even Buddhism. In fact, I’m going to share a fantastic metaphor to make this even more visual and easy to understand and apply in your life.

You will also learn:

How to use my 6-word phrase to interrupt your worries and self-doubt.
The question you can ask yourself to beat fear with logic.
A beautiful Buddhist teaching that will empower you to stop torturing yourself mentally.
A shocking study about how stressful thoughts cause you real pain.
What “positive ideation” is and why you need to use it the next time you start to spiral.
What the data says about your worries (my jaw was on the floor).
Exactly how to train your brain to be more optimistic.

Bottom line: You have the power to quiet anxious thoughts and to stop the endless loop of worries that run through your head.

You just need the 6 magic words I’m about to teach you right now.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, researcher, respected expert on intermittent fasting, and bestselling author of Fast Like A Girl, Dr. Mindy Pelz, is here to explain fasting—and, in particular, how it impacts women’s hormone health.



Men and women’s hormones are different, and because of that, women MUST fast differently than men.



Dr. Mindy is the first person who explained this to me, and this is why I wanted to have her on.



I had no idea that fasting would screw up my estrogen and progesterone. Why? Because I first learned about fasting from a male.



When I tried intermittent fasting, I wasn’t seeing the health benefits that everyone talks about. Now I know why.



You’ve seen fasting advice trending on TikTok and in health articles; even your friends are talking about it (just like mine), and after this episode you will know exactly what fasting is, why you might want to do it, and what every woman needs to know to get started.



I want you to get the right information from a respected female expert in this field.



Everyone needs to hear this. 



This conversation is loaded with research and resources, and as always, extensive show notes are available on melrobbins.com. You can find them for this episode here. (www.melrobbins.com/podcasts/episode-103)



Today, Dr. Mindy Pelz reveals:



The scientific protocols you need so you can fast the right way.
How to fast with your 28- to 30-day cycle for hormonal, physical, and mental health (and what to do if you’ve lost your cycle, like me).
The hormone science about how the female body operates (no one talks about this).
How to manage PMS and why intermittent fasting may help.
The research that explains why fasting tanks your progesterone
How this relates to you if you are in menopause and have an irregular cycle.
What the 30-day reset is, and its powerful ability to transform your health.
How to incorporate fasting into your life (and never miss a good meal with your family and friends).
Why coffee doesn’t break a fast, but a frappuccino does.
3 hacks to get started with a fast that will make your fasts more successful.
The 6 fasting windows and their unique and extraordinary health benefits.



We are going to focus on the step-by-step guide for women, what to do, and why this matters, but we do cover fasting protocols and how-to advice that both genders need to know.



I learned so much from Dr. Mindy, and as with all episodes, this is a free resource where you get to learn straight from somebody who has literally written the book on this topic.

      <itunes:subtitle>In this episode, researcher, respected expert on intermittent fasting, and bestselling author of Fast Like A Girl, Dr. Mindy Pelz, is here to explain fasting—and, in particular, how it impacts women’s hormone health.



Men and women’s hormones are different, and because of that, women MUST fast differently than men.



Dr. Mindy is the first person who explained this to me, and this is why I wanted to have her on.



I had no idea that fasting would screw up my estrogen and progesterone. Why? Because I first learned about fasting from a male.



When I tried intermittent fasting, I wasn’t seeing the health benefits that everyone talks about. Now I know why.



You’ve seen fasting advice trending on TikTok and in health articles; even your friends are talking about it (just like mine), and after this episode you will know exactly what fasting is, why you might want to do it, and what every woman needs to know to get started.



I want you to get the right information from a respected female expert in this field.



Everyone needs to hear this. 



This conversation is loaded with research and resources, and as always, extensive show notes are available on melrobbins.com. You can find them for this episode here. (www.melrobbins.com/podcasts/episode-103)



Today, Dr. Mindy Pelz reveals:



The scientific protocols you need so you can fast the right way.
How to fast with your 28- to 30-day cycle for hormonal, physical, and mental health (and what to do if you’ve lost your cycle, like me).
The hormone science about how the female body operates (no one talks about this).
How to manage PMS and why intermittent fasting may help.
The research that explains why fasting tanks your progesterone
How this relates to you if you are in menopause and have an irregular cycle.
What the 30-day reset is, and its powerful ability to transform your health.
How to incorporate fasting into your life (and never miss a good meal with your family and friends).
Why coffee doesn’t break a fast, but a frappuccino does.
3 hacks to get started with a fast that will make your fasts more successful.
The 6 fasting windows and their unique and extraordinary health benefits.



We are going to focus on the step-by-step guide for women, what to do, and why this matters, but we do cover fasting protocols and how-to advice that both genders need to know.



I learned so much from Dr. Mindy, and as with all episodes, this is a free resource where you get to learn straight from somebody who has literally written the book on this topic. 



I would definitely send this to absolutely anyone that needs to hear it.

      <itunes:summary>Lately, I’ve been getting a ton of questions from listeners about how to best support high schoolers and 20-somethings. There are lots of questions about anxiety, peer pressure, and getting young adults to open up. 

So, in this episode, I have a pile of your questions in front of me as my son, Oakley, and I go through them rapid-fire style, so you get both of our perspectives on the topics everyone worries about but is too afraid to talk about.

I have to say, Oakley really showed up for this conversation for you. He has hilarious and heartfelt thoughts on topics he has first-hand experience with. 

We cover it all. From academic pressure to body image to bullying, this conversation is full of tools and strategies and is raw, unfiltered, and filled with relatable stories (and only a few f-bombs).

(If you only get one thing from this episode, make it this…) How to encourage the young men in your life to open up.
The ONLY thing you need to do when your young adults come home in a bad mood.
How to get unhooked from toxic popularity and cliques and find your people in school or in life.

How to get your kid to do chores (and still like you).
Strategies for handling your kid’s anxiety without yelling or freaking out.
The best way to navigate curfews and late-night parties with your teen.
 

I can’t wait for you to hear this. I loved the questions and the advice. And as a mom, I couldn’t be more proud of Oak for how much wisdom he shared.

I’d love for you to listen with your teens and 20-somethings. In fact, at the end of the episode, Oakley gives specific advice (including exactly what to say) to get your kids to listen.

      <itunes:summary>In today’s episode, best-selling author and therapist KC Davis answers the question, &quot;How can you be successful in many areas of your life but fall short on getting the laundry, dishes, or grocery shopping done?&quot;

Which begs the question: why are all the &quot;little tasks&quot; so hard?!

Because when it’s time to get them done, they don’t &quot;feel&quot; so little.

KC’s advice, breakthrough ideas, and research will make you realize you’re not the only one who feels like you’re drowning.

And her compassionate, hilarious approach and simple tools will help you take better care of your home and yourself immediately.

If you’ve ever said:

Why can’t I get it all done?
Why does everyone else do this without a struggle, and I am FAILING?
I should really have my act together….

All the answers you need are in this episode.

And if you (or someone you love) is having a moment where even taking a shower or brushing your teeth feels like climbing Mount Everest, KC Davis is an angel sent from the heavens to lift you up.

This is one of my favorite conversations of all time. It’s so wide-ranging in topics and deeply relatable, laugh-out-loud funny, poignant, and actionable.

Talking to KC is like having an old friend show up at your house with a mug of tea, a mop, and a casserole you can stick in the fridge.

There are so many life-changing realizations that will restore your sanity—and the functionality of your home—that this is only Part One of your time with KC and me.

Today’s episode will change your entire life. You will learn:

A shocking approach to laundry and anything else in life that changes everything. (This one is so goooood!)
3 rules for self-care made simple
A 5-step tidying method that will improve your life
A genius trick for when the dishes or laundry are piled sky-high
KC’s &quot;momentum-building trick&quot; that will make your brain work for you
Making relaxation your right, not your reward
Leveraging self-compassion as a motivational tool
KC’s favorite phrase to say when she feels overwhelmed



My mission today is to prove to you that if you don’t have your sh*t together, you aren’t broken. You’re just like the rest of us – you’re human.  

Get ready to laugh and learn as I confess the details of what a disaster I am at home, as we go step-by-step with instructions and affirmations for an empowering and gentle journey to a functioning space.

Xo, Mel

3:30: Why is it sometimes so hard to do even the small things?

9:15: Your disappointment in yourself goes so much deeper than chores.
10:30: Here’s what your piles of laundry say about you. OR don’t.

      <itunes:summary>In today’s episode, you and I are discussing the fascinating science of secrets: why you keep them and how keeping secrets directly impacts your relationships, your self-esteem, your health, and holds you back from living the life you deserve.



Dr. Michael Slepian is a bestselling author, psychologist, associate professor of leadership and ethics at Columbia Business School, and former scholar at Stanford. He has been researching secrets for over a decade and will help you understand what secrets are, why we keep them, and the harm of holding them inside.



Dr. Slepian&apos;s research is shocking: studies prove you are keeping 13 secrets right now. 5 of which you’ve never told a single person. Not your mom. Not your best friend. No one. Even more shocking is the impact they have on your life.



My mission today is to help you free yourself of the burden of secrets.



Listen and you’ll understand how the secrets we have shape our physical and psychological well-being, who we are, how we connect with others, and how we cope with our challenges.



You will also learn:



The most common secret that 61% of you are keeping right now.

Why you always feel shame, isolation, and uncertainty when you keep a secret.

The fundamental difference between secrecy and privacy, and why privacy is better for your health and relationships.

Why the shame of secrecy kills your self-esteem.

How to use guilt to get rid of shame (yup).

How babies learn to keep secrets from their parents and caregivers.

The one person you should REALLY tell your secret to.



Keeping a secret is the easy part; the hard part is having to live with it.



Let’s change that today.

      <itunes:duration>00:44:02</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>In this episode, you and I are dismantling one of the most crippling forms of self-doubt.



&quot;Imposter Syndrome&quot; is when you think you’re not good enough and that everyone else is smarter, more successful, and has more to contribute than you do. Everyone feels it. It’s so common that the Harvard Business Review found that even 70% of the world’s top executives have struggled with it.



My mission today is to convince you that Imposter Syndrome is actually a GOOD thing. And I’ll use an example from my own life to prove my case.



Come backstage with me to a huge music festival, where my daughter Kendall, an aspiring singer-songwriter, comes face-to-face with the famous musicians who inspired her career.



Cue the panic.



Self-doubt almost made her bail on what turned out to be a life-changing weekend in her career.

She turned it around (you’ll hear how) and, as a result, was invited impromptu to perform twice with Grammy-winning musicians!

Listen and learn how to be more courageous and confident in those moments that really matter. I can’t wait for you to hear:



The 4 words Kendall repeated that crushed self-doubt and got her on stage.
The powerful mantra to say when you’re nervous walking into a room.
How to use humor (and tuna sandwiches) to connect with anyone.
Why being a &quot;nobody&quot; is the most amazing &quot;somebody&quot; you could be.





It’s time to hit delete on your self-doubt forever.



This one is so good and so relatable that you’ll be yelling, Encore!



Xo, Mel



In this episode, you’ll learn:

2:15: Harvard Business Review says imposter syndrome is #1 fear of executives.
3:40: Kendall puts us at the scene of her own paralyzing episode of self-doubt.
5:30: Imagine being surrounded by everyone you’ve admired your entire life.
11:30: This is the message you need to hear if you’re deep in self-doubt.
12:45: My own story of feeling like an imposter before I became a speaker.
19:30: Here’s how to start shifting your mindset and boost your confidence.
20:20: The piece of advice that will help you stand taller.
21:40: The three-letter word you need to repeat when your insecurity creeps in
22:30: Once you change your mindset, your actions fall into place.
24:00: You have a gift to offer even the most experienced people in your field.
25:00: The seven words Kendall dropped that I’m still thinking about.
27:15: The #1 takeaway from this conversation about self-doubt.
28:45: Own where you are, and here’s what we mean by that.
31:00: What you’re thinking will happen probably won’t.
33:00: Learn how to balance giving and receiving, and you&apos;ll crack the code.
35:15: Are you waiting for validation? Listen to this.
38:00: There’s a reason you’re here. Here’s how to start believing that
41:00: Here’s why imposter syndrome is a GOOD thing.

Listen, and you’ll learn:
 
The mistakes we (and other parents) made and how to fix them.
How to set powerful boundaries that everyone knows and respects.
The most tactical way to deal with difficult relatives and their BS.
The 6 words that increase trust in any relationship.
What to do when you repeat the same toxic relationship patterns.
5 secret words that will get your kids (or anyone) to tell you the truth.
One simple tool that makes discipline and boundaries easier for you.
(and your kids)
 
 
Share this episode with your family, and consider listening to it WITH your kids. It’ll definitely spark an interesting conversation because we get real and raw, and hold nothing back.
 
If you’re looking to get closer to someone you love, this episode is exactly where you should start.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, you’re going to learn that it is never too late to try to repair a broken or difficult relationship.

Research shows that estrangement is not only on the rise but that the majority of us have at least one extended family member or friend who is estranged.

I know this is true in my own extended family, and I also have friends who are estranged from their parents.

Whether you’re the person who’s cut off contact or you&apos;re the one wondering why someone you love did, our episode today will give you the language, tools, and context to start moving toward understanding and healing.

Dr. Joshua Coleman is a psychologist and best-selling author who works with families to repair broken bonds and help them reconcile and improve difficult or estranged relationships.

In fact, according to Dr. Coleman, the strategies he shares work, and the statistics are in your favor.

I hope you share this with anyone you know dealing with a difficult relationship. It is very common, especially after a divorce and when there is a new spouse or significant other.

When someone you love suddenly pulls away or cuts you out of their life, you need a playbook to help you know when to reach out and when not to reach out, and what exactly to say and not say.

Today you’ll learn:

Why estrangement is on the rise.
What some therapists do wrong that can make things worse.
What to do if you’re the sibling caught in the middle.
How to take responsibility, even if you don’t think you should.
Early mistakes we make that can lead to estrangement.
Early steps we can take to avoid estrangement.
How long it takes to reconcile and where to even begin.
The pain of separation is real, but it doesn’t have to be forever.

I’m proud to introduce you to my husband, Chris, who is the founder of a men&apos;s retreat, Soul Degree. He has been leading these retreats for the past 6 years and has worked with everyone from veterans, executives, and first responders to college students.
 
Chris has incredible insight into the secrets that men keep and the struggles they’re facing alone.

Many of the struggles that he witnesses in other men are the exact same struggles that he has worked through as well.
 
This is an episode every man, boy, or anyone who identifies as male needs to hear, and so do the people that love them.
 
It’s not just we women who struggle with self-love; everyone struggles with loving themselves. 
 
If you don’t know what’s going on with the men in your life, let me talk to them and let them know it’s okay.
 
That’s why I am teaching you how to start loving yourself with a simple habit that you can add to your routine.
 
Today you’ll learn: 

The 5 shocking things that most men in your life are struggling with
One habit that has helped hundreds of thousands of people to start showing self-love
Why it’s so hard to love yourself and the secret to self-love
The science behind why this habit is transformative
The profound insight my husband Chris had when he took the 5-day challenge 
 
Love is not something you feel; it’s something you must demonstrate.

      <itunes:summary>More and more adults are being diagnosed with ADHD, so today, we are unpacking the 6 surprising signs of ADHD. I also tell you why so many women, in particular, go undiagnosed.
 
This episode is deeply personal, but my story is shared by so many women.
I lived my entire life with symptoms of ADHD and crushing anxiety because of it. But I was never diagnosed until the age of 47—and I found out by fluke!

So in this episode, I go deep into what ADHD is: a neurological disorder that affects the brain structurally and chemically. I explain the signs and the science behind what is going on in your brain to help you live a better life.

If you ever wondered if you have ADHD, if you feel like menopause is making it worse, or if you struggle with anxiety, an eating disorder, or low self-esteem, you have to listen. All these might be symptoms of ADHD.

This episode goes way beyond an inability to focus, because ADHD is so much more. This is an education in how your brain works, how focus works, and how to help yourself or someone in your life who may have ADHD.

I’ve been wanting to record this episode for MONTHS, but I didn’t want to do it until I had first-class resources for you. Because every time I talk about my ADHD story, we get an avalanche of questions from listeners.

I have regrets about that lost time when I did not know I had ADHD, and I don’t want you to have them, too.
 
Today you’ll learn:
 
*why women have been profoundly underdiagnosed
*four key differences between genders with ADHD
*why my diagnosis was both a blessing and a curse
*the surprising way most women find out
*six symptoms of ADHD that most people don’t catch
*the connection between anxiety and depression and ADHD
*resources and hacks to help you take charge over your symptoms

9:00: The definition of ADHD that may make you feel better about yours.

19:30: This is how ADHD impacts your brain.
22:30: Breaking this myth about this symptom of ADHD.
24:45: A really clear metaphor to explain how your brain silences noise, or doesn’t.
32:00: How is it I have ADHD, yet I can hyper-focus?
34:00: More surprising symptoms of ADHD that might make your relationships hard.

      <itunes:duration>00:48:51</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>Today we are digging into the research on gratitude. Gratitude is a critical life skill, yet most of us are practicing it wrong.
 
That’s right.
 
According to the research, there are 4 essential elements of genuine gratitude. Without all 4, you can’t unlock the powerful physiological, neurological, and psychological benefits of genuine gratitude.
 
For example, if you’re just thinking about what you’re grateful for or writing a list before you go to bed, you’re probably not getting the full impact of its power.
 
Once you know the 4 steps, you can use genuine gratitude to actively rewire your brain!
 
Next, we’ll discuss the “Toxic Gratitude Theory” and the 6 ways you probably use gratitude in a backhanded or manipulative way – and don’t even know it!
 
I’m guilty of all 6 types of toxic gratitude (ouch) and now that I see it, I can stop doing it.
 
So today, let’s learn how to unlock gratitude and all its profound power. You’ll also learn…


The 4 neurotransmitters involved in a science-backed gratitude practice
The important difference between being just “thankful” versus genuinely “grateful” and why it matters
How using one specific word is critical to building up your resilience
What to say to someone who’s going through a really tough time
 
And because I’m so genuinely grateful for you, I have started rolling out a fun bonus with each episode, Mel Robbins Podcast Bloopers, so listen all the way through for a good laugh!

In this episode, you’ll learn:


6:00: Ever met someone who just makes you feel so loved and grounded?
12:20: What happens in your body when you feel more gratitude?
16:00: What’s the difference between being thankful vs. gratitude?
21:40: Here are the four important elements of genuine gratitude.
25:00: Are you using gratitude in a toxic way? Hear these six types of toxic gratitude.
26:00: Let’s unpack the #1 way we engage in toxic gratitude.
28:10: The #2 type of toxic gratitude is actually resentment in disguise.
29:45: This #3 type will keep you stuck in what’s not working for you.
33:00: We use the 4th type of toxic gratitude to escape uncomfortable emotions.
36:00: Being mentally well means giving yourself the space to feel all emotions.
37:30: Let’s unpack how you use the 5th type when you don’t know what to say.
39:00: And please don’t use this type to downplay your accomplishments.
41:00: This is one of my favorite acceptance speeches ever.
43:00: I looked up the meaning of Judah’s name and couldn’t believe what I found.
46:00: So how do you stay grounded in a chaotic environment? Listen to these tips.

      <itunes:summary>If you’ve ever dreamt of doing something big, today&apos;s episode will get your head spinning, open your heart, and inspire you to take the leap.
 
It doesn’t matter how young or how old you are.
 
You are meant to go big, to swing for the fence, and to do something no one has ever done before. 
 
No more small plans. You have something big to do.
 
And there’s no better person to inspire you to make big plans than my friend and IT Cosmetics Founder, Jamie Kern Lima. 
 
Jamie went from serving up stacks of pancakes at Denny’s to creating a product that would help millions of women around the world feel confident in their own skin. 
 
Today you’ll hear the story of how she transformed the beauty industry, created the most successful product launch in QVC history, and ultimately sold IT Cosmetics to L’Oreal for 1.2 billion dollars (becoming the first female CEO at L’Oreal in their history). 
 
If you think Jamie had it easy on the way there, you’d be wrong. And you won’t have an easy time either, but so what?
Her story is a rollercoaster of rejection and disappointment, fear, self-doubt, and near bankruptcy.
 
But when you’ve got big plans, you just keep going. Jamie never lost faith, and today she is teaching you how to never give up on your big plans either.
 
 
In today’s episode, you will learn 

What to do when you have no idea what you’re doing.
Why it’s okay to do something that’s been done plenty of times.
What it’s like to pitch live on QVC.
How to handle someone saying “Women won’t buy from someone who looks like you.”
How to believe in yourself when nobody else does.
A truth about success we rarely ever hear about.
What to do when QVC says “NO you can’t sell that way.”
How to react when some idiot tells you they won’t invest in you.
How to break into an industry event and pitch your idea.
How to harness belief in yourself when you want to give up.
Wow. Just wow.

      <itunes:summary>Welcome to an exciting new masterclass on designing the life of your dreams.

First, you’ll learn the process for identifying your own North Star, why this is important at the beginning of creating your new life, and how to use your North Star to guide you in the process of designing your life.

Next, you’ll dive deep into the 3-part framework: Emulate, Assimilate, and Innovate.

This framework is the backbone of the University of Southern California’s world-renowned Popular Music major taught at their Thornton School of Music.

It’s the creative process artists use to create songs, movies, and video games. The framework has helped launch Grammy-winning artists and touring musicians for the past decade.

I just learned about it a week ago and was so blown away that I had to share it with you.

When an artist creates a song, they begin with a blank piece of paper.

When you design your life, you are an artist with a blank canvas.

Today, you’re invited to tap into the artist within and learn how to find your North Star and use the creative process to bring your vision for your future to life.

In this episode, you’ll learn:


3:00: Hear me describe the woman who recently became MY North Star.
6:40: Choosing this kind of person you want to choose as your North Star is best.
8:00: Shout out to Chris Sampson from the Thornton School of Music for these pillars.
10:15: If you skip Step One in this process, you’re making your life much harder.
14:15: Here’s how Jennifer Aniston made her way into our conversation. 
18:10: We start unpacking what Step One of the process looks like, first with music.
21:00: Think of the space in between where you are and want to be as special. 
22:15: Try using “want” instead of “need” when it comes to goals and see what happens.
25:20: This is what I did when I first started to dig myself out, but it took me much longer.
28:00: Here’s why this person is my North Star and why he puts a fire in my belly.
31:15: Let’s define the first two steps in this important process and how they’re different.
34:00: How do you know when you’re done and you’ve become your own North Star?
41:45: Kendall’s biggest takeaway from working through this process. 
42:45: The way I sign out on all my podcasts was inspired by this woman.

      <itunes:summary>I shared the &quot;Let Them Theory&quot; on social media, and it went CRAZY VIRAL. 15 million views, 11,000 comments. Today, it’s your turn to learn this mindset trick.
I’ve been using this technique for a while, so I know firsthand how powerful it is.

The &quot;Let Them Theory&quot; is so simple, you’re going to get it immediately.

And I have some great stories and examples to share with you, because there are three very different ways you can use it.

I can bottom line this in one sentence: 

When you &quot;Let Them&quot; do whatever it is that they want to do, it creates more control and emotional peace for you and a better relationship with the people in your life.

Xo Mel 

In this episode, you’ll learn:
2:30: My overfunctioning anxiety kicked in, until this happened.
6:30: Dr. Amy Johnson gives the best metaphor that explains our need to control.
9:20: Why do we get so upset about what we can’t do a damn thing about?
10:30: These three reasons explain why we try to control. 
11:20: Two reasons why your parents and partners are so controlling.
17:00: There are times like these when the “Let Them” rule does NOT apply.
19:00: How are you supposed to let go when you’re a parent?
24:30: Can you relate to this listener who’s worn down from her expectations?
28:00: Stop making up stories about why people do what they do, and just ask.
32:10: When you’re constantly rescuing people, here’s what you teach them.
35:00: Are you actually in a relationship with a real person, or a vision?
37:15: One way we try to control someone is through jealousy.
40:00: Growing apart from a good friend? Here’s how to handle it.
43:30: It’s not your responsibility to make sure everyone else is never hurt.

      <itunes:duration>00:51:21</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>If you feel that something’s missing from your life but have no idea exactly what’s missing or where to begin looking for it, today’s episode will help you reconnect with your power and find greater meaning in your life.

Dr. Thema Bryant is the current president of the American Psychological Association. She trained at both Duke and Harvard, published multiple best-selling books, and has dedicated decades of her life to researching how we connect with each other by first connecting back to ourselves.

Her work has been so profound for me personally that, right off the bat in this conversation, I get emotional.

Dr. Thema is a national treasure. Her presence and her voice will put you at ease. And she has the unique gift of weaving together psychological strategies for healing with the deeper spiritual cornerstones of faith and trusting in &quot;that which cannot be explained.&quot;

In this episode, you’ll learn:

-6 signs that you are disconnected from yourself

-what it means to be &quot;psychologically wandering&quot;

-how to handle people in your life who are chronically irritable and angry

-the surprising signs of &quot;irritable depression&quot;

-the three words to say to yourself before you can begin healing

-why self-care is critical if you are in a toxic workplace (you are more than your labor)

-why you need to stop talking about your significant other and your boss in therapy.

-where to find therapy when you can’t afford it.

You are so much more than a highway for other people to get where they’re going. With Dr. Thema’s wisdom and tactics, you’ll reconnect with yourself and take the wheel on your own incredible journey in life.

In this episode, you’ll learn:

11:00: The West African fable that gave me chills and should be required reading for everyone.
16:00: This is the first and most powerful step to your “homecoming.”
22:00: Do people with an attitude actually have depression?
25:20: What is healing, anyway?
27:00: How do we handle people in our lives who are irritable, frustrated, and angry?
30:00: It’s a big mistake if you wait for this before you start your own healing.

      <itunes:summary>Imagine how liberating it would be to not care about what other people think of you. You’d take more risks. You’d stop holding yourself back. You’d make more money and have more fun. 

That’s what happened to me when I learned the (not-so-subtle) art of not giving a sh*t.

This is the best episode I&apos;ve done so far.

I mean it. The best.

It’s hilarious. It’s relatable. It’s packed with takeaways and research. It’s entertaining and personal, and yet I still manage to empower you with 4 simple ways to stop caring about what other people think.

Want to know what life looks like when you don’t care?

 I’ll go first.

You’ll hear some outrageous, not-safe-for-work stories about your friend, Mel.

And as you’re laughing at me, I’ll be laughing at me, too. One of the benefits of not caring about what other people think is that you don’t take yourself too seriously.

Why? Because you have much more important things to care about.

Xo Mel 

In this episode, you’ll learn:

4:00: Hilarious story of me taking my shirt off at an LA restaurant.
8:30: Christine says you’re not supposed to show up to meetings this way.
14:30: Here’s why wearing ballet flats would have been a failure for me.
16:00: Christine’s profound point about judgment really opened my eyes.
19:00: When you stop worrying about how you look, others around you will too.
23:00: What I think about ugly troll comments so that I can rise above it.
27:00: If you’re part of a gossip loop, here’s what you need to do.
28:00: It’s not normal to wear a child-size space suit in front of your students?
34:00: Jessie could not stop laughing after I did this.
36:00: How can you give honest feedback and not sound like a jerk?
38:00: The wake-up moment for me around relationships.
38:30: My four rules about how not to give a sh*t about stupid stuff.
48:30: Kendall revealed something to me that I still can’t believe.

      <itunes:summary>You know what you want and how to start.
 
But you never make progress.
 
Here’s my wake up call for you today:
 
What’s holding you back is never what you think.
 
Today I am coaching a woman who says:
 
I can’t make myself do what I need to do. I feel like I’m in quicksand. Every time I try to move…I sink.
 
She has:
-put on an extra 30 pounds
-left her relationship with herself in the gutter
-no longer does the things that make her happy
-broken promises to herself time and again
 
I bet you can relate. 
 
This is a must-listen if you want to: 
 
be healthier…
go back to school..
find your dream home…
make new friends…
go for that promotion…
write a book…
land your dream job…
 
But you just can’t make yourself take the actions you need to take.
 
Stop frustrating yourself by trying to solve the wrong problem. 
 
Your dreams matter. 
 
Today you’re learning where to find the right solution.
 
Pull up a seat for a conversation with a listener like you as we uncover what’s really holding her back.

      <itunes:duration>01:11:50</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>In this episode, you’re going to learn how to decode body language from one of the world’s leading experts on the topic.
 
Janine Driver has been trained by the FBI, CIA, and one of the world’s top hostage negotiators.
 
When a criminal case grabs our attention, every news network calls Janine to analyze body language and critical verbal cues that suspects, politicians, and celebrities are sending so we can tell when somebody is lying.
 
If you love True Crime, you’re going to love this episode, because it’s a masterclass from an expert who’s spent over three decades decoding body language for law enforcement agencies around the country.
 
She will teach you which hand gestures indicate that somebody may be lying, why you should grab your chin during a high-level meeting, why you should never shrug your shoulders if you want to be convincing, and the million-dollar question that you should ask at the end of every single interview.
 
If you’re dating, you’ll learn all kinds of incredible tactics, like why you should never sit directly across from someone on a first date. 
 
This is an incredibly interesting, entertaining, and surprising take on how to build confidence and be smarter about the subconscious signals that other people are sending you all day long.

      <itunes:subtitle>In this episode, you’re going to learn how to decode body language from one of the world’s leading experts on the topic.
 
Janine Driver has been trained by the FBI, CIA, and one of the world’s top hostage negotiators.
 
When a criminal case grabs our attention, every news network calls Janine to analyze body language and critical verbal cues that suspects, politicians, and celebrities are sending so we can tell when somebody is lying.
 
If you love True Crime, you’re going to love this episode, because it’s a masterclass from an expert who’s spent over three decades decoding body language for law enforcement agencies around the country.
 
She will teach you which hand gestures indicate that somebody may be lying, why you should grab your chin during a high-level meeting, why you should never shrug your shoulders if you want to be convincing, and the million-dollar question that you should ask at the end of every single interview.
 
If you’re dating, you’ll learn all kinds of incredible tactics, like why you should never sit directly across from someone on a first date. 
 
This is an incredibly interesting, entertaining, and surprising take on how to build confidence and be smarter about the subconscious signals that other people are sending you all day long.

      <itunes:summary>Last week, I learned a really cool trick to help you go with your gut.

I guarantee you’ve never heard gut decisions explained this way before. Because I stumbled upon it in a very random way—while touring colleges with our son Oakley!

We hit 5 schools in 4 days, and over the course of that time, it hit me. Holy smokes, that&apos;s the perfect hack for making big decisions.

You can use it anytime you feel torn, uncertain, or scared about how people might feel.

What you’re about to learn is so helpful and memorable, you’ll turn to it over and over again.

This is one of my favorite kinds of episodes, because I’m going to put you right at the scene—the moment I had the epiphany. I’ll give you all the hilarious details, and there’s even a part of the story where, I am embarrassed to say, I acted pretty cringe-worthy.

And that’s not all; as I was taping this episode, two friends chimed in with stories of their own.

So I asked them to jump on the mic and share them with you. Two stories about a moment in their lives that’s so relatable—when they ALMOST didn’t go with their gut and looking back, they’re thankful they did.

Because going with your gut always changes the trajectory of your life. It just does.

That’s why I don’t like the term &quot;trust&quot; your gut.

It’s not about trust. You KNOW your gut is right. You’re just scared to go with it.

So join me, Oakley, and two of my friends. I’m taking you on an entertaining and profound tour today.

Xo Mel 
 
In this episode, you’ll learn:
 
3:30: The moment of my junior year in high school that changed my future.
7:00: I am not proud of this mother moment when I lost it.
11:00: The question Oakley asked is what we all do when we give up our power.
14:15: Here’s what a hard no “feels” like for Oakley.
15:45: Do you feel a “yes” in your body like this too?
17:00: What our brilliant tour guide did when he separated parents from students.
20:30: When it comes to big decisions, step away and go on your own tour. 
22:00: Here’s what a “no” and a “yes” usually feels like in your body. 
24:00: You’re going to love Amy’s “next big thing” story and how she just knew.
31:00: We all have an opportunity in our lives to use this powerful tool.
33:00: And if it doesn’t work out the way you thought it would? Listen to this.
33:45: Do you have the courage to do this?
36:30: So what do you do when you hear the NO louder than the YES?
40:30: Jessie literally followed her heart and became her own “tour guide.”
42:30: Stop staying you don&apos;t “trust your gut” and start saying this instead.
43:00: Take time to do this EVERY day, but especially when you have a big decision.

      <itunes:duration>00:41:54</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>Oh…sometimes life is a real doozy.

You make all these plans, and boom. You step right into a pile of you-know-what. And then you realize that pile was there all along—you just missed it.

Which brings us to the topic of today’s episode: making hard decisions and moving on from hard relationships.

How do you move forward when… 

You feel so torn about what to do.

You don’t trust yourself.

You’re scared to make the wrong decision.

What’s best for you will impact the people you love.

How do you decide your next big move when everything you worked for evaporates before your eyes? 

How do you stop thinking about your ex, especially when you might bump into them at any moment?

I’ll tell you how.

Pull up a seat and join me because you are going to love the listener, Katrina, who I’m coaching today. Her question was, &quot;Should I stay or should I go?&quot;

By the end of this episode, you’ll not only have the answer to whatever question YOU are grappling with, but you&apos;ll also have so many decision-making tools in your back pocket that you’re going to need more pockets.

Today, you’re getting strategies to help you

Live your life with no regrets.
Keep your cool when you see your ex.
Bounce back after rejection.
Stop feeling guilty about following your dreams.
Make courageous decisions.
The biggest takeaway? Knowing the difference between what’s right for you and the fear that’s keeping you from it

When something is right, even if it’s scary as hell to go for it, you’ll only ever regret not having tried.

      <itunes:summary>At some point, the you-know-what is going to hit the fan.

And it happened to me the other morning when I was driving my husband to his colonoscopy.

This is the first episode without a video version because I recorded it from my iPhone after dropping my husband off at the hospital.

I promised to take you into my life; I just didn&apos;t expect it to be as a stressful situation was unfolding in real time.

When it comes to dealing with stress, best-selling psychotherapist and researcher Harriet Lerner says that being an underfunctioner or an overfunctioner is your patterned response to dealing with the alarm in your body.

It probably doesn’t surprise you that I am what researchers call an &quot;Overfunctioner.&quot; 

My husband, Chris, is an &quot;Underfunctioner,&quot; especially on those days when he’s on the way to a medical procedure.

And learning the way YOU react to stress is a game-changer for your relationships.

An overfunctioner like me allows the alarm in my body to take over in stressful situations, becoming triggered and anxious.

And the only way to calm the alarm is to bark orders, manage the phone calls, organize the activities, make the appointments, plan the meals, and take on all the responsibilities because it gives me a sense of control.

It may be my superpower, but it also makes me a royal pain in the a$$ and takes away the chance for Chris to feel empowered.

The way Chris deals with stress is more chill and very methodical, which frustrates the hell out of me.

Listen today as we work through these two different ways of dealing with a stressful family situation so that you can understand your own approach better and, more importantly, how to ask for what you need from others before you drive them nuts.

And if you’re ready to take the next right step to live your life with more confidence and no regrets, this is your time.

      <itunes:summary>You can be rich.

(Don’t roll your eyes at me; I’m serious.)

This is not what you think.

This episode today is so digestible. So counterintuitive. One of the most enlightening conversations I’ve had with anybody. 

If I had a nickel for every epiphany I had during this episode, I’d be rich.

Most of us have been thinking about money all wrong.

It turns out that the amount of money you have in the bank (or don’t have in the bank) is only a small part of your relationship with money.

I didn’t realize this until I got to sit down with the incredible Ramit Sethi.

He’s a NYT best-selling author and finance advisor with a brand new, top-ranked Netflix series called How to Be Rich, where he coaches real people about how to take control of their financial lives.

He says you’ve been thinking about money all wrong. 

This is one of my favorite conversations ever.

It changed the way I think about money.

If you were told that you need to create a budget and stick to it, Ramit calls BS.

Instead, you’ll learn about your money dials, the only four numbers that matter, the 85% Rule, why the 10 Year Bucket List is so important, the one thing you should NEVER say about yourself, and best of all, what it means to live a Rich Life.

Today’s episode is going to change the way you SEE money, because when you see it differently, you’ll treat it differently.

If you’re feeling crushed by debt, you’re trying to save for a new home, you can’t stop spending, or you’re constantly getting into arguments with your partner over money issues, you need to hear this episode today.

You have to learn to feel confident around money, and Ramit has the practical tools and resources to teach you how.

And if you’re looking for another zero-cost resource to help you change your mindset around finances, I’ve got just the thing.

Sign up for my free training called Take Control with Mel Robbins. 
 
You’ll be joining a quarter million other students who’ve signed up already and you’ll get 3 incredible video trainings plus a 21-page workbook that will help you get the clarity you’re looking for to change the direction of your life. All you have to do is sign up here.

12:45: How do your childhood influences impact your beliefs around money?

      <itunes:duration>00:53:42</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>A few years ago, I found this study from Harvard, and it changed my life.

It&apos;s research about performance and feeling nervous, with a simple reframing method that you can use to never let fear stop you again.

I’ve been using this technique with my five second rule for years, and the first way I applied it was to get control of my nerves and fear of public speaking.

I’m going to teach you this new method in a super cool way... by taking you on the road, on stage, and behind the scenes with me as I deliver a keynote address to 3,000 people at the convention center in Dallas.

I’ve been wanting to bring you on the road with me for awhile, and this topic allowed me to record this episode live in multiple locations while all kinds of things were unfolding.

There’s even an impromptu guest appearance from Michelle Poler, whose entire speaking career is about teaching people how to face their fears.

This Harvard-backed technique is so cool because it leverages your body chemistry, physiology, and neural pathways to your advantage.

The #1 fear most people have is public speaking, but this technique will help you with absolutely everything, whether it’s speaking up at work, giving an incredible presentation, not choking when you deliver the toast at your best friend’s wedding, performing better on tests, or even running better.

Stop letting fear hold you back. Use science not only to reframe your fears into excitement but to conquer them once and for all.

And one more thing. My free, brand new, research-backed training called &quot;Take Control with Mel Robbins&quot; is live and waiting for you. Get 3 incredible video trainings plus a 21-page workbook, and all you have to do is sign up here.

Already a quarter of a million students are taking the course for free.

I’m just waiting for you!

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, you’re learning a simple but powerful way to take control of your mindset. 

You need to get serious about your mindset. The way you think and talk to yourself has serious consequences.

Your thoughts become your beliefs.

Your beliefs turn into actions.

Your actions become habits.

And your habits determine who you are and what you achieve in life, or not.

That’s why you need a Mindset Reset.

Imagine if your thoughts were positive, empowering, clear, and encouraging. Imagine if your beliefs inspired the best in you.

If you’re tired of listening to a voice that beats you down, fills you with doubt, and argues against your goals and dreams, it’s time to change your thinking.

Today, you’ll learn how to do it for yourself and start programming a more positive, empowering, and confident mindset.

So pull up a seat as I coach two people through the process.

I’m so confident you’re going to be fired up after listening to this episode that I have a free gift to help you take your current mindset to the next level.

I have a brand new, free, 3-part training called &quot;Take Control with Mel Robbins.&quot;

It will provide you with the coaching, structure, and support you need to hit reset, take control, and level up your life.

It features 3 brand-new training videos, two hours of research-backed curriculum taught by me, and a 21-page workbook. Plus you’ll be with hundreds of thousands of other students taking the course for free around the world.

All at zero cost to you. Why? Because you deserve it, and it’s my way of thanking you for being here with me.

You’ve got nothing to lose and everything to gain. Why not take advantage of this opportunity? I’ll see you in the course!

Xo Mel 

In this episode, you will learn:
 
5:00: What does your default critical soundtrack sound like in your mind?
7:30: Here’s the mantra I want you to start your day with. 
9:45: This is one of my easiest and favorite tools for dealing with a critical voice.
16:00: This is the #1 hit playlist I want you to put on repeat. 
17:30: Drop this word if you want to improve your relationship with others.
22:30: Work on the most important relationship of all first.
24:15: What if your critics are the voices of your boss, partner, and friends?
26:25: This trauma response is very common when you live in a state of anxiety.
30:15: Here’s why telling yourself that you love yourself doesn’t work for you.
32:00: Yes, your boss may be a douche, but you don’t have to let that ruin you.
35:00: Don’t leave today without taking away this message.

After you meet our expert today and learn her revolutionary approach to simplifying your life, you will never approach the topic of picking up, cleaning up, or organizing the same way again.

I had no idea how simple it could be to feel organized and in control.

I learned from our expert today that I was attacking organization completely wrong, and that was the problem.

Her 5 steps are so life-changing that from the moment I finished talking to her, I started putting them into practice, and the results are incredible.

Get ready to laugh and learn as I confess the details of what a disaster I am (my husband even rats me out).

6:20: Focus this way on organizing, and it will change your life.
7:30: Why doesn’t it work to buy all those organizing containers?
9:45: How do you know what your “clutter threshold” is?
12:15: We’ve gotten the purpose of containers all wrong!
17:40: Use “the visibility rule” before you do anything.
20:00: This is why you begin with a BLACK trash bag.
23:30: This part is still pretty easy. I can do this and you can, too.
25:00: Here’s why you don’t want a fancy “donate” box.

      <itunes:title>The Toolkit for Healing Anxiety, Part 1</itunes:title>
      <itunes:author>SiriusXM Podcasts</itunes:author>
      <itunes:duration>00:51:44</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>Today’s episode is my gift to you and anyone in your life who struggles with anxiety.

I created this exclusive series, &quot;The Toolkit for Healing Anxiety,&quot; because of the number of questions I am receiving from listeners asking for more resources on this topic. 

Part 1 is packed with tactical takeaways and features Dr. Russell Kennedy, one of the world&apos;s most respected medical experts on anxiety. 

Dr. Kennedy is a medical doctor and neuroscientist who has a revolutionary and effective approach to helping his patients understand and heal anxiety.

(He&apos;s also been our most popular expert on the podcast to date.)

Dr. Kennedy teaches you the truth about where anxiety comes from and the mistake that most therapists make when treating it. 

You’ll also have a front-row seat as he coaches listeners on the critical difference between &quot;coping with anxiety&quot; and his protocol for &quot;healing it&quot; once and for all.

I can’t wait for you to listen and apply the advice in this life-changing series.

And for anyone in your life who may be struggling, please share this exclusive series generously; it could provide the answers and guidance they need.

If you have follow-up questions, send them to me in the DMs or through the podcast topic link on melrobbins.com/podcast. We read them and use them to program future episodes (this toolkit is an example of that).

This episode is not meant as a replacement for therapy, but if you’ve been seeing a therapist for a while and aren’t seeing yourself improve, you may want to forward this series to them for guidance too.

·         5:00: I bet you haven’t heard this definition of anxiety before. . 
·         6:15: So where exactly does anxiety come from?
·         7:30: This is a revolutionary way of thinking about how to heal anxiety.
·         8:45: If you’re waking up this way, that’s a red flag. 
·         9:45: A trauma response isn’t directed outward- it’s here instead.

·         24:00: I think there are these three layers to healing your anxiety.
·         27:15: What the hell does “inner child” mean and why does it matter?
·         30:00: There’s a difference between drama and trauma. 
·         34:00: Dr. Kennedy tried everything, but only this healed his anxiety.
·         37:00: Okay, what’s one specific and tangible tool we can use?
·         40:30: Do this together with me now.
·         44:00: Here’s why play is so important for healing trauma.

      <itunes:summary>Today, you and I are calling BS on partners, friends, siblings, colleagues, and roommates who ride on your coattails, mooch off your generosity, and love the fact that you do everything. (While they do next to nothing.…)
 
It’s time to take your power back with 5 actionable takeaways to get people in your life to step up and do their part.
 
I’m not messing around. The first person you’ll meet in this episode is tired of being the only one holding her family together.  
 
And during the second coaching session I get even more intense with a woman whose boyfriend hasn’t had a job in three years.
 
Hear me loud and clear: by enabling other people, you are part of the problem. 
 
There are 5 things you need to know that will change this dysfunction now.
 
Clear your schedule for the next hour because you and I have an appointment where you, my friend, will learn how to lay down the law and start putting yourself first.

21:30: Have a partner that isn’t pulling their weight? You need to hear this.
35:00: This is how you start a conversation when it’s time to set boundaries.
38:30: In a toxic partnered relationship? This is the truth bomb you need.
40:15: Has it become more important to be loved than to love yourself?
44:45: Let me coach you through this exercise to help you change your future.
48:00: Another truth bomb you need to hear today, no matter what you’re doing.
51:45: Listen to Brooke set a courageous boundary for the first time.
54:00: Keep little ears away, because this is what tough f’n love sounds like.

      <itunes:duration>00:39:41</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>In this episode, you and I are talking about how to protect your peace.
 
You already spend a lot of time trying to be positive - so today I want to remind you that it is just as important to protect your energy  from people and situations who suck it dry. 
 
You know the ones. 
 
The friend who is so n-e-g-a-t-i-v-e, about everything! 
The rude person at the coffee shop. 
The colleague who’s always stirring the pot.
The toxic dynamic with certain family members.
 
Negative people are like dogs who have just jumped into a muddy pond. They come running up to you smelling all nasty and as soon as they get next to you - boom - they shake all that crap all over you. 
 
It’s time to protect yourself.
 
Today’s podcast episode will teach you six super easy science-backed strategies to help you create an impenetrable force field against bad energy (and muddy dogs).
 
You can’t allow that crap to get on you - because your positive life force deserves your protection!
 
And today I’m teaching you how.  Force fields up! Positive energy out!
 
Because that, my friend, is something to feel great about!

9:15: The “snow globe” works best when you’re getting attitude.

14:30: Science explains why our bodies stress when we’re around bad moods.
17:20: Work in a toxic environment? You have these two choices.
22:40: Dealing with a curmudgeon? I got you. Use the law of reciprocity.

29:30: Gossip is bad for your brain and body. Here’s why.
31:30: Here’s the #1 strategy to stop your gossip today.

      <itunes:summary>In today’s episode, I’m finally answering the #1 personal question that I get asked:
 
What’s the story behind my tattoo on my right wrist?
 
Pull up a seat to laugh along with us as Chris and I share our tattoo adventure - complete with anxiety, jealousy, intention, love, a huge mistake on my part, and the most incredible moments of synchronicity.
 
But it’s not just a story; there’s a much more profound topic we are discussing today. 
 
Because tattoos aren’t really about tattoos. 
 
They are an example of a powerful, positive force that habit researchers call an “environmental trigger.” 
 
They’re also an example of another tool that you can use to create a more powerful and resilient mindset.
 
Because a lot of tattoos are also “meaningful mantras.” 
 
Today, you will learn how to create and use positive triggers and meaningful mantras to improve your life and to remind you of either a deeper purpose or the values you want to live by.
 
This goes way beyond etching ink onto your body. 
 
By the end of this episode, you’ll not only be inspired to create your own meaningful mantra, you will have several specific examples of how you can create a positive environmental trigger using things you have around your house. 
 
One thing’s for sure, this episode will leave a lasting impression. 😄

19:00: You might know this already, but a tattoo isn’t just a tattoo. 
21:00: I just love the synchronicity behind this entire tattoo event.
24:30: Chris’s tattoo has become a lifeline for him, especially now.

      <itunes:author>SiriusXM Podcasts</itunes:author>
      <itunes:duration>00:56:57</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>In this episode, you’re learning how to speak up for yourself and make sure that you are heard.

Whether you want to be more influential and visible at work or there’s a hard conversation that you’ve been avoiding with a family member, this episode will empower you to have a breakthrough.

Most of us have never been taught the skills we need to have challenging conversations or to better advocate for our needs.

The good news is that these are skills, and you are going to learn them in a very entertaining and relatable format today.

You’re invited to listen in on multiple coaching sessions with listeners just like you and me who are struggling to find the words or the courage to say what needs to be said.

So today I’m unpacking my formula, step by step, for handling challenging conversations.

This is an excellent episode to send to people in your life who you really wish saw their own value and worth and could communicate it better.

I can’t wait to hear how these very clear steps have helped you have those conversations you’ve been putting off and to show up differently at work and school.

Happiness is misunderstood.

Fortunately, there’s a ton of research that explains why it can be so elusive and, even better, HOW you can create a happier life, starting today.

Our conversation about happiness begins with breaking down the two types of happiness and why it’s important for you to include both in your life.

You’ll also learn four practical takeaways that research says are key for cultivating more happiness in your daily life.

I love this episode, and I can’t wait for you to experience it! I am bringing the science and the strategies, and I have a phenomenal metaphor to share with you that will forever change the way you view happiness.

You’re not only going to learn what to do; you’re going to experience several listeners just like you who are seeking more happiness and fulfillment in their lives.

This is a highly relatable, entertaining, and transformative episode, so don’t miss out.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, you are getting a brand new definition of confidence.

This definition is based on research studies on how confidence is built.

Confidence is not what you think it is.

It is not a personality trait you’re born with, and it’s not reserved only for extroverts.

Confidence is a skill that anyone can master.

And today is the perfect day for you to start.

You and I are breaking down the science together, and you’re invited to join in as I coach several listeners who are struggling with self-doubt.

By the time this episode is done, you will not only have a brand new definition of confidence, but you will also know how to put that definition to use to start building unstoppable confidence in your own life.

Confidence is your birthright. You can’t lose it; you just lost your connection to it.

Let’s get that back.

If you are willing to get up every day and put one foot in front of the other, you, my friend, will not only be practicing and building confidence, but over time you’ll start feeling more confident too.

      <itunes:summary>This is an episode about how to face the things that you’re scared to admit, or as in the case of my guest today, have never publicly spoken about.

Today, you and I are going on a healing journey so that you can put the past where it belongs: in the rearview mirror.

You deserve healing.

It’s the only pathway for experiencing true peace, happiness, and the greatness you’re capable of.

So, I’m introducing you to a friend of mine who had some serious sh*t to face and has spent the last several years addressing the things that used to drag him down.

Do not miss this deeply personal conversation.

It is profound. It is relevant to your life and packed with so much wisdom. And we jump right in. 

There are so many mic-drop moments, it would be hard for me to pick just one, because my guest today was so unguarded and generous.

You may know him, but you’ve never heard him like this before.

I’m talking about Lewis Howes, host of the award-winning podcast, The School of Greatness, which just celebrated its 10-year anniversary and has over 500 million downloads.

His brand new book, The Greatness Mindset, teaches you how to discover your own unique gifts and talents, but more importantly, how to do the work to heal.

And look, this conversation is “unguarded” and covers sensitive topics (particularly perhaps for the men in your life). So if this isn’t for you right now – please skip this episode.

I cannot wait to hear your favorite and most meaningful parts of this unforgettable conversation with Lewis.

      <itunes:subtitle>This is an episode about how to face the things that you’re scared to admit, or as in the case of my guest today, have never publicly spoken about.

Today, you and I are going on a healing journey so that you can put the past where it belongs: in the rearview mirror.

You deserve healing.

It’s the only pathway for experiencing true peace, happiness, and the greatness you’re capable of.

So, I’m introducing you to a friend of mine who had some serious sh*t to face and has spent the last several years addressing the things that used to drag him down.

Do not miss this deeply personal conversation.

It is profound. It is relevant to your life and packed with so much wisdom. And we jump right in. 

There are so many mic-drop moments, it would be hard for me to pick just one, because my guest today was so unguarded and generous.

You may know him, but you’ve never heard him like this before.

I’m talking about Lewis Howes, host of the award-winning podcast, The School of Greatness, which just celebrated its 10-year anniversary and has over 500 million downloads.

His brand new book, The Greatness Mindset, teaches you how to discover your own unique gifts and talents, but more importantly, how to do the work to heal.

And look, this conversation is “unguarded” and covers sensitive topics (particularly perhaps for the men in your life). So if this isn’t for you right now – please skip this episode.

I cannot wait to hear your favorite and most meaningful parts of this unforgettable conversation with Lewis.

8:00: If you were bullied or didn’t do well in school, you’ll relate to this.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, you are going to learn how to put yourself first.
 
Which means you and I are having a conversation about people-pleasing.
 
You know you do it. I do it, too. 
 
In fact, unless you&apos;re a narcissistic jerk (and you’re not if you’re listening to these podcast episodes), we are all people-pleasers to some extent.
 
Being a people-pleaser is a coping mechanism and it is destroying your energy, your time, your dreams, and your sanity.
 
Every time you say yes to something you don’t really want to do, you’re saying no to yourself.
 
Today, we’re changing that in a surprising way.
 
First, you’ll become aware of when and why you do it.
 
Second, you’ll learn the science-backed tools you need to break the habit of always putting other people’s needs before your own.
 
Third, you and I are going to have a talk about guilt, because when you start saying no, one thing I can guarantee is that you’ll feel guilty about it.
 
I used to, too. I don’t anymore. And I’ll explain how you can handle the guilt and still put yourself first. One of the critical steps to creating a life you love is learning how to say yes to what matters to you and no to what doesn’t.
 
This is a big topic; there are a lot of surprising layers.
 
So I can’t wait for you to apply these relatable and easy strategies to your life and to hear about your breakthroughs.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, I’m on a mission to open your eyes to new possibilities.
 
What do you really want from your life?
 
And how can you reimagine your next career move to help you fulfill it?
 
If you’re feeling stuck in a job you hate, were just laid off or fired, just graduated, or you have no idea what you want to do with your life, this episode is my gift to you.
 
I wanted to do something to help you gain the clarity and courage that you need to make a big change when you’re feeling uncertain.
 
So I’ve arranged for you to meet with one of the best experts on the planet for a zero cost masterclass and coaching session on getting clear on your next career move, Amy Porterfield.
 
Her new book, Two Weeks Notice, is the playbook for how you build a successful side hustle or business with zero prior experience.
 
Amy’s taught more than 50,000 people just like you how to go from dreading their job to designing the life and work they’ve dreamed about.
 
Today Amy is coaching you, and when you’re done listening to our conversation, you’ll not only be inspired, but you’ll also have the tactical next steps to take.
 
And, if you’ve ever quietly dreamt of having your own business, my mission today is to pour gasoline on that fire.
 
After you listen, you’ll think differently about what you’re capable of, and you’ll get a taste of what COULD be.
 
I always say you are one decision away from the rest of your life.
 
If you’re ready to design a life you love waking up to, we’re about to teach you how.

      <title>If You Struggle With Anxiety, This Episode Will Change Your Life</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, you’re invited to sit in on a really personal and raw conversation with our 17-year-old son, Oakley.</p><p> </p><p>Whether you experience anxiety yourself or you’re just worried about someone you love who does, this episode is a powerful gift from my family to you.</p><p> </p><p>What Oakley shares based on his personal experience is life-changing.</p><p> </p><p>You will hear Oakley describe two periods of anxiety and some pretty scary and overwhelming thoughts that rose up freshman and sophomore years of high school.</p><p> </p><p>I am sharing this with you because Oakley is not alone in what he experienced.</p><p> </p><p>According to the CDC’s most recent data, anxiety in teens and adults continues to rise, with nearly half surveyed reporting persistent feelings of hopelessness. </p><p> </p><p>Whether you’re an adult or a teen, depression and anxiety are two of those mental health conditions that leave you feeling isolated from everyone because it can seem like you’re the only one having these kinds of overwhelming thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>Today, in real-time, Oakley shines a light on what he experienced and how he worked through it.</p><p> </p><p>And don’t worry, this isn’t a downer.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, you’re invited to sit in on a really personal and raw conversation with our 17-year-old son, Oakley.



Whether you experience anxiety yourself or you’re just worried about someone you love who does, this episode is a powerful gift from my family to you.



What Oakley shares based on his personal experience is life-changing.



You will hear Oakley describe two periods of anxiety and some pretty scary and overwhelming thoughts that rose up freshman and sophomore years of high school.



I am sharing this with you because Oakley is not alone in what he experienced.



According to the CDC’s most recent data, anxiety in teens and adults continues to rise, with nearly half surveyed reporting persistent feelings of hopelessness. 



Whether you’re an adult or a teen, depression and anxiety are two of those mental health conditions that leave you feeling isolated from everyone because it can seem like you’re the only one having these kinds of overwhelming thoughts.



Today, in real-time, Oakley shines a light on what he experienced and how he worked through it.



And don’t worry, this isn’t a downer. In typical Oakley fashion, he has me laughing as much as I was sighing.



Two really important things come out of this conversation:



#1: You get an inside view of what anxiety can look and feel like, and #2, you get to learn about the healing process Oakley engaged in with family, a therapist, his doctor, and medication to work his way through it and back to a clear, confident, and happy state of mind.



I want to be clear. Oakley has chosen to share his own personal experience. With his therapist’s help, Oak feels more connected and empowered to ride the ups and downs of life and create deeper meaning in his life. And that’s what we want for you.



So many of you write in to thank us for sharing these conversations with my adult kids because they help you open up conversations.



Well, today’s conversation is meant to serve the same purpose. You may want to listen to this with people you love. 



And please, share this.



Share it with teachers, coaches, nieces, nephews, and parents who you know could use these insights.



Too many of us try to deal with anxiety on our own. Let Oakley inspire you and the people you love to open up.



You are not weird or messed up if you have fleeting dark thoughts, but if those thoughts persist, please reach out to a therapist, family, or friends. You don’t have to go through this alone.



And if this topic is not for you right now, bookmark this episode and come back to it at another time. But it is a deeply powerful one you won’t want to miss.

In this episode, you’ll learn:



2:20: Is your loved one resistant to therapy? Here’s what to do.
4:15: My son schooled me on therapy and why I should have done it for myself sooner.
6:30: I had no idea he was feeling this way.
8:40: Oakley describes his panic attack and dark thoughts.

This episode is very tactical and covers 5 simple but essential components of a perfect morning routine.

I’m really glad that you’re taking this topic seriously because every successful person you admire is serious about their mornings.

I sure am.

How you set up your day is typically how it ends up.

I love my morning routine so much that I call it the Million Dollar Morning, because it makes me feel like a million bucks for the rest of my day – and it creates a level of discipline in my life that helps me make millions of dollars too.

But let me be clear: I am not naturally a morning person.

And if that’s been your excuse, my mission is to change your mind.

If you already have a morning routine, listen to this episode to take it up a notch.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, we are talking about the #1 thing you can do to make sure tomorrow is a productive and awesome day.

I’m sure you know the importance of a good morning routine.

But what you may not know is that a rock-solid morning routine – the kind that kickstarts you and your day for maximum focus and to feel more in control, calm, and like the rockstar that you are… 

It doesn’t start where you think. 

If you truly want to own your day, you must first own the night before.

That’s right. 

Hours before you even lay your head on your pillow, your decisions have either set you up for success or they have set you up to fail.

Your brain is primed to be the most productive during the first 2-4 hours of the day. That’s why I want you to get serious about how you set yourself up the night before.

This episode is packed with research-backed tactics, specific advice, and the four science-backed components of the best evening routine.

And this is also one of those tough-love, hit you with the common-sense, friend-to-friend conversations that you know and love from me.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, you and I are getting a masterclass on the topic of love.

And it’s not what you think. 

This is not an episode about relationships – it is an episode about YOUR relationship to love and how you can let more love into your life. 

My mission with this episode is to inspire you to stop and consider the profound subject of love, how important it is, and why you deserve to feel more love in your daily life.

If you have felt alone or feel like your relationships are on autopilot, this episode is a real gift.

I am also excited because as you listen to this episode, I get to introduce you to someone I really love. 

He and his wife are very dear friends of ours and he just finished a two-year-long research project on the topic of love. 

This friend of mine is also a former monk with a tender heart and a global fanbase. 

His sage counsel on life is sought after by celebrities, world leaders, professional athletes, and the most successful artists in the world.

I’m talking about none other than my friend, Jay Shetty. He’s the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Think Like a Monk, and his latest book is 8 Rules of Love.

Climb into your favorite chair and get ready for a wild ride. 

I threw out the talking points from Jay’s PR team and just went for it. I love this episode because Jay delivered. 

He gets personal and reveals more about his own experience and mistakes with love than ever before.

This is a must listen and a must share. Listen as a family. Listen with friends. Listen as a couple. Listen by yourself. Love is what we need. And hearing two dear friends go deep on the topic will make your heart swell.

Even an old dog like me learned a few new tricks about how I can experience more love and be more loving in my life ❤️

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, I’m getting brutally honest with you about relationships. 
 
Our conversation begins with a question from a listener who asked me for advice on how to make your relationship go the distance in this messy modern world.
 
I’ve always shied away from giving relationship advice, mainly because after 26 years of marriage, I know the only secret is this: it takes a lot of consistent work.
 
I also don’t consider myself an “expert” on the topic because our relationship seems to always need attention. It’s so easy to silently retreat to your corners and not address the issues. And there were years where we did just that.
 
In fact, over the past few years, Chris and I have been working through some really heavy issues with a couples therapist.
 
Today I share very personal revelations I’ve had about my own role in causing problems between us. After all we’ve been through, I’m really proud of my husband, Chris, and me for making it this long and doing the work to make it better.
 
In the process of working hard to improve our relationship, I learned six powerful lessons that I felt compelled to share with you. Not because I hold the magic wand, but because I hope these lessons will save you the pain and heartaches I’ve caused myself and my husband.
 
No matter what kind of relationship you might be in, working on, struggling with, or hoping to save, these six lessons will provide a roadmap to make it better.
 
Whether you are married, dating, divorced, happily single, or experiencing a falling out with a friend, this episode will have something for you.
 
About halfway through, another listener asks,
 
“What do I do if my partner doesn’t want to do the work?” 
 
In that case, there’s just one rule for when it’s time for you to move on.
 
Oh, one more thing, if you and your partner are having a hard time… Share this episode with them. It’s a simple way to open the door for a much-needed conversation.

      <itunes:subtitle>In this episode, I’m getting brutally honest with you about relationships. 
 
Our conversation begins with a question from a listener who asked me for advice on how to make your relationship go the distance in this messy modern world.
 
I’ve always shied away from giving relationship advice, mainly because after 26 years of marriage, I know the only secret is this: it takes a lot of consistent work.
 
I also don’t consider myself an “expert” on the topic because our relationship seems to always need attention. It’s so easy to silently retreat to your corners and not address the issues. And there were years where we did just that.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, you will learn how to deepen your healing by understanding how your parents may have created silent trauma that is still impacting you as an adult.
 
I want to introduce you to a woman who has had a really big impact on my own healing. 
 
She is the renowned psychologist and #1 New York Times bestselling author, Dr. Nicole LePera, who you may also know as The Holistic Psychologist.
 
Today, Dr. LePera will normalize the common experience of having few memories from childhood.
 
This is something that I struggled with silently. I personally have very few memories from my childhood, and I assumed there was something wrong with me.
 
It was only when I started sharing about this lack of memories online that I realized I wasn’t the only person who can’t reminisce about their past.
 
I now understand why this happens. I also know there is nothing wrong with me.
 
And if you have very few memories from your childhood, there’s nothing wrong with you either.
 
Today, we are digging into parenting styles and how your childhood experiences (whether you remember them or not) are still impacting the way you respond to stress as an adult.
 
The research and tools in this conversation will help you understand not only why it’s so easy to get triggered, but also how to deepen your healing journey now that you do.
 
This is one of those episodes that I also know you will be sending to family, friends, and siblings because there is so much empowering information here.
 
I personally made all three of our kids listen because I both recognize as a daughter how my childhood impacted me – and as a mom, I’m also very aware that my parenting style has impacted my kids.
 
And, Dr. LePera so beautifully teaches us how to take control of the rest of our lives as adults.
 
Xo Mel 
 
PS: After you listen to this one, listen to “Take Control of Your Life: A Toolkit for Healing” if you haven’t yet, because I’m sharing details from the last few years of my healing journey.
 
Plus, there’s a companion workbook to help you go deeper.
 
In this episode, you’ll learn:


3:00: So many of you wrote in about this particular detail of trauma.
8:00: Childhood amnesia – What the heck is that?
9:30: Here are 3 reasons why you don’t have many childhood memories.
11:30: What do psychologists mean by “dysregulated nervous system?”
15:00: Introducing my friend and world-renowned psychologist, Dr. Nicole LePera.
17:45: What’s an emotionally immature parent and how do you know if you had one?
24:30: Two big reasons why your brain shuts down in childhood.
28:00: Do you need to remember your past trauma to recognize it in yourself?
35:00: What does it look like in real life when you start to heal your nervous system?
37:30: Is trauma only for those who’ve lived through a big, horrific event?
44:00: Here is why the silent treatment can be harmful. 
48:00: Here’s your first tactical step toward healing your body and mind.
53:15: Feeling cynical about your own healing process? You need to hear this.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, I’m making the topic of trauma easier to understand by taking you step by step through my recent revelation that I was struggling with past trauma.
 
I was one of those people who thought I didn’t have trauma. And you may be like that too.
 
But if you have trouble managing emotions, expressing your feelings, dealing with upset, you go on edge easily, you have trouble focusing, or you struggle with anything like anxiety….
 
This will be very eye opening.
 
The words “trauma” and “nervous system” are thrown around like candy online.
 
I want to share the profound things that I’ve learned about both topics and how I’ve started to address and heal the trauma in my nervous system.
 
This episode is personal, it’s important, and tactical, and most of all – it’s packed with tools you can start using right now.
 
I hope this episode opens your eyes in the way that it did mine, and makes you not only understand this topic – but yourself a little bit better.
 
And, to go deeper, I have a free 9-page workbook for you that serves as a companion to this episode to help you with your own healing.
 
Just click here to access it. 
 
And, this episode covers sensitive material, including discussion of trauma and sexual assault. If this topic isn’t for you right now – please skip this episode.

In this episode, you’ll learn:


0:58: This episode is one of the most important I’ve ever created because of the powerful impact these learnings have had on my life. It will be the same for you.
7:40: What is trauma anyway?
8:40: Do you recognize yourself in these signs of past trauma?
10:00: Getting honest: my personal story.
21:15: What happens to me when I hear the sound of crunchy snow (and how this applies to you).
24:00: Do you have to remember trauma to heal from it?
30:30: If I have little-T trauma, does that mean my parents are to blame?
34:40: This is what your nervous system is (and it’s not what I used to think).
43:15: Here’s why your triggers were helpful then and why they’re not now.
50:00: How can you get yourself out of survival mode and start to focus again?
54:00: The difference between your two nervous systems.
56:30: Six takeaways to help you switch from fight or flight to rest and recovery

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, you’re about to learn how to make your new habits stick.
 
If you’ve struggled to be consistent with behavior change, you’re not alone. It’s easy to talk about habits. It’s a whole different thing to apply the science to your life.
 
You are not the problem.
 
The problem, when it comes to habits, is the lack of systems and hacks that help you stay consistent.
 
There are 5 very specific, simple systems backed by science that you have to have in place if you want to make your new habits stick for good.
 
It doesn’t matter if you’ve already bailed on your New Year’s resolutions or if the only habit you think you’re successful at is failing at habits. I’ve got you.
 
If your treadmill just became the most expensive laundry hanger you’ve ever purchased, then this episode is for you.
 
I’ll say it again: 
 
It’s not you; it’s your lack of systems.
 
Stop relying on willpower to get you through.
 
That’s not what you need. The research says you need systems.
 
Today, I’ll teach you 5 essential ones.
 
Let’s go, because your behavior toolkit masterclass series continues.

15:55: The five systems that will help you finally stick to your habits
24:00: A simple hack from Harvard Business School to help you make better decisions
28:25: The simple trick that helped people be twice as successful at quitting smoking

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, you’re going to learn exactly what you need to form new habits.
 
Even if you think you already know everything there is to know about habits, you probably still struggle to apply this knowledge and make change stick.
 
And if this topic is brand new to you, don’t worry; I have a way of explaining it that’s fun, and so simple even a 5-month-old puppy can understand it.
 
Just because it’s science doesn’t mean it has to be complicated and boring.
 
When we make change fun and easy to understand, you’re more likely to be successful in applying all of this research.
 
That’s why this episode also comes with a free companion workbook, so that you not only listen and learn, but also go deeper and apply what you’re learning to your own life.
 
You can download that for free at melrobbins.com/habits.
 
I’ll teach you the three critical parts of forming new habits, and together we’ll unpack the brain research that explains why these parts are essential to your habit-making routine.
 
When you’re done listening, you’re going to see that you’re making the same mistake most people make: you’re only focused on one part of forming a habit, and you’re missing the other two.
 
I’m really excited for you to listen, learn, and apply all this knowledge.
 
New habits begin as something you practice, and after applying this over time, they become who you are.

15:50: Why are habits important?

      <itunes:summary>I want this year to be the best year of your life. 

So we’re going to talk about the one habit that researchers say has the biggest, overall impact on the quality of your life. 

And that habit is learning to be kind and loving to yourself. 

We all know we need to learn how to love ourselves, but no one has taught you HOW. 

Until now.

In this episode, I am teaching you how to start loving yourself with a simple habit that you can add to your morning routine. 

I’ve got loads of research to prove why this habit matters and how it will change your life. 

And bring your Kleenex.

Today I’m not only answering questions from some listeners about self-love, I also invited my husband, Chris, to come on and explain why he thought this habit was so stupid when I first shared it with him. 

The conversation took a turn that I was not expecting.

It gets very personal and both Chris and I end up crying. He shares details about a period of his life where the shame and sense of failure were so palpable that he couldn’t even look himself in the mirror. I’m so proud of him, and moved by his vulnerability.

This is an episode every man, boy, or anyone who identifies as male needs to hear. It’s not just we women who struggle with self-love; the men in your life are struggling, too. That’s why we all need to be practicing this habit every single morning. 

You’re going to learn that love is not something you feel; it’s something you must demonstrate. And that’s what I’m going to teach you to do. 

You’ll want to listen until the very end, because you’ll meet a woman whose entire life trajectory changed by simply trying this habit once.

Want to learn more? All of the research - and there’s a lot of it - is linked in the show notes at melrobbins.com/podcast. And if you want to watch a longer, unabridged version of this episode, visit my YouTube channel.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, I am sharing 8 brand new studies and exciting new research about simple changes supported by science that can help you improve your day to day life, like…


How to cut your gym time IN HALF and still get the same benefits. 


The surprising sound researchers say will boost your mood for EIGHT hours. 


The research on how mindfulness reduces your anxiety by 30% -  the same as Lexapro.


And so much more


I’m also joined by Tracey, who leads our research and has helped me produce five #1 Audible Originals and all the science behind it. 


She’s found the studies; we are breaking them down together, and having a ball as we do. 


This episode is going to make you smarter and is packed with the tactical, simple, and science-backed tools that I know you love learning on this podcast. 


Pull up a seat and let’s go.


Oh! And one more thing. As always, all of the research - and there’s a lot of it - is linked in the show notes at melrobbins.com/podcast. And if you want to watch a longer, unabridged version of this episode, visit my YouTube channel.

      <itunes:summary>Have you ever had one of those years where life seems to punch you in the face?
 
Where one thing after another knocks you down, over and over, until you start to feel like you are never getting back up.
 
Well, that was this past year for me.
 
People I trusted betrayed me. Plus, I was living 150 miles away from my husband and son, alone in Boston during the week for work. I never saw my friends because I was too busy working. I wasn’t exercising. I wasn’t taking care of myself in general. Honestly, I felt really lonely all the time.
 
And looking back at pictures of myself from that time, it’s easy to see all of that in my face.
 
I think we all know that the greatest lessons in life come from the most challenging things that you face. And while it’s true, it’s not easy when you are in the middle of it.
 
This past year taught me 3 invaluable lessons, and today I’m sharing them with you. 
 
I know you’re going to nod along because you know these lessons are true.
 
I don’t know why they are so damn hard to learn, but my hope is that by sharing what I struggled through and what I learned from, it will save you the headache and heartache that this year put me through.

      <itunes:duration>01:06:15</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>I’ve got a very special invitation for you today.
 
Grab a spot on the couch next to me and my family here in Southern Vermont. 
 
Join our family as our three kids discuss all the parenting mistakes Chris and I made – and the things we did that built trust and brought us all closer.
 
I’m really excited and proud to share this with you, even though there are moments where my kids absolutely school me.
 
They also share wisdom and insights that are so profound, you’ll hear Chris break down and cry.
 
This really isn’t a conversation about parenting at all. It’s about how you create a close and meaningful connection with anyone.
 
So whether you’re wondering how to get closer to your family or your friends, everything we discuss applies to all relationships.
 
This episode goes deep – we cover drinking, drugs, addiction, and what to do when teenagers stop talking to you or someone you love is dating someone that you don’t like.
 
And, since so many of you have written in asking about my approach to parenting after hearing our kids on various episodes of this podcast, I’m also sharing our parenting philosophy.
 
My family is getting real and raw in this discussion, and we’re inviting you to be a part. So join us. I can’t wait to hear your thoughts on this episode, and one thing you might want to consider is listening to it with your family. I guarantee you, it will spark very interesting discussions.

      <itunes:summary>I know you’re busy. Which is why today’s message is the one thing you need to hear right now.
 
I need this message too. We all do.
 
Because there’s only one thing I want you to do this week:
 
NOTHING.
 
That’s right. I want you to do absolutely nothing.
 
No, I’m not smoking anything funny when I say this. I’m dead serious.
 
Hear me out.
 
There is an art and a science to doing nothing, and we need to put it into our daily lives.
 
All this constant doing is impacting your energy, your drive, your stamina, and your ability to be present, which in turn affects the decisions you make and your relationships.
 
Look at it this way. What are you doing right now?
 
Because I bet you’re scrolling through podcast episodes to listen to as you jump on your Peloton, drive to work, fold laundry, organize your desk, or whatever it is you do when you multitask.
 
You and I live in a world that glorifies productivity and accomplishment. The busier we are, the more important we must be.
 
But all that busyness is not making you happier or healthier. In fact, you’re writing to me every day asking how to deal with burnout and overwhelm.
 
And look, I’m not exactly an expert. I struggle with this too, which is why I wanted to talk about it.
 
I can’t even take a freakin’ bath without feeling the urge to answer emails on my phone (and oftentimes, I do).
 
Like you, I have absolutely no idea how to do nothing.
 
But I know I need to learn how to turn off and unplug, even if it’s just for a minute.
 
This episode is the tough love that we all need. And it won’t require you to take a week off from work or be somebody who meditates all day. 
 
We’re going to talk about how to create moments of peace in your daily life, no matter how complicated it may seem right now.
 
So whether you’re on vacation, studying for exams, running your own company, raising a family, or you’re in between three jobs, this episode is for all of us. And it’s one you deserve.

      <title>I Didn’t Expect to Record This: I Want to Talk to You About tWitch’s Death</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I’m checking in on you and me. There's a lot going on in the world right now, and I am still reeling from the news that Stephen ‘tWitch’ Boss died from suicide.</p><p> </p><p>If you had to ask me to list the 5 most positive people on the planet, The Rock would be #1, and tWitch would be #2.</p><p> </p><p>Having lost too many friends and people I love to mental health challenges like depression, addiction, trauma, and hopelessness – all of who died from suicide – I’m just so heavy with emotion. </p><p> </p><p>tWitch was beloved by millions for being Ellen DeGeneres’ executive producer, dance partner, and DJ on her talk show. He was a part of people’s lives 5 days a week, for years. He competed on So You Think You Can Dance and he had one of those million-dollar smiles that just lit up every room he walked into. He is followed by millions of people online who love the adorable dances that he, his wife Allison, and his 3 kids do.</p><p> </p><p>Seeing such a bright light like tWitch go out so suddenly at the age of 40, with 3 beautiful kids, a huge life, and adoring fans around the world…</p><p> </p><p>It just stirred up so much sadness inside of me, and this may be stirring up a lot inside of you. </p><p> </p><p>You don’t have to know tWitch personally (I didn’t – I am just a fan) to be profoundly impacted by the news of his death.</p><p> </p><p>This may be bringing up experiences of loss from your own life. It may also be reminding you of moments when you were really struggling, which is another reason why I felt the urgency to talk to you today.</p><p> </p><p>And I thought, maybe you’re sad too.</p><p>Or having a hard time processing how someone who seemed to “have it all” and “so much talent” could come to a point where this could happen.</p><p>Or maybe you are going through a tough time yourself.</p><p>Or maybe you just need a friend to tell you it’s going to be okay and give you a boost.</p><p> </p><p>So I wanted to connect.</p><p> </p><p>I decided to roll out of bed, get right on the mic, and share what I'm feeling and how I'm thinking about tWitch's death so we can process this together.</p><p> </p><p>Please take 14 minutes to listen to this powerful message.</p><p> </p><p>I share my thoughts about how to process news like this and I also emphasize something tWitch always said:</p><p> </p><p>Be kind.</p><p> </p><p>Today, be kind.</p><p> </p><p>You never know what another person is going through, so be kind.</p><p>And always, be kind to yourself.</p><p> </p><p>One thing you can do today is reach out to people you love. You never know what it’s going to mean to someone. If you don’t know what to say, you can share this episode.</p><p> </p><p>And, if you are in pain right now. PLEASE. There’s a difference between wanting to end the pain you feel, and wanting to end your life.</p><p> </p><p>You can end the pain with support and by taking small steps forward every single day. </p><p> </p><p>It can and it will get better.</p><p> </p><p>Please, if you need help, pick up the phone. You deserve support.</p><p> </p><p>Trained volunteers are standing by to help you. Call the National Suicide Hotline, which is 988 in the US. Different languages are available – <a href="https://www.therapyroute.com/article/helplines-suicide-hotlines-and-crisis-lines-from-around-the-world" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p><p> </p><p>Or, text HOME to 741-741 for the Crisis Text Line.</p><p> </p><p>Thanks for reading this and listening to this episode.

      <itunes:author>SiriusXM Podcasts</itunes:author>
      <itunes:duration>00:15:34</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>I’m checking in on you and me. There&apos;s a lot going on in the world right now, and I am still reeling from the news that Stephen ‘tWitch’ Boss died from suicide.

If you had to ask me to list the 5 most positive people on the planet, The Rock would be #1, and tWitch would be #2.

Having lost too many friends and people I love to mental health challenges like depression, addiction, trauma, and hopelessness – all of who died from suicide – I’m just so heavy with emotion. 

tWitch was beloved by millions for being Ellen DeGeneres’ executive producer, dance partner, and DJ on her talk show. He was a part of people’s lives 5 days a week, for years. He competed on So You Think You Can Dance and he had one of those million-dollar smiles that just lit up every room he walked into. He is followed by millions of people online who love the adorable dances that he, his wife Allison, and his 3 kids do.

Seeing such a bright light like tWitch go out so suddenly at the age of 40, with 3 beautiful kids, a huge life, and adoring fans around the world…

It just stirred up so much sadness inside of me, and this may be stirring up a lot inside of you. 

You don’t have to know tWitch personally (I didn’t – I am just a fan) to be profoundly impacted by the news of his death.

This may be bringing up experiences of loss from your own life. It may also be reminding you of moments when you were really struggling, which is another reason why I felt the urgency to talk to you today.

And I thought, maybe you’re sad too
Or having a hard time processing how someone who seemed to “have it all” and “so much talent” could come to a point where this could happen.
Or maybe you are going through a tough time yourself.
Or maybe you just need a friend to tell you it’s going to be okay and give you a boost.

So I wanted to connect.

I decided to roll out of bed, get right on the mic, and share what I&apos;m feeling and how I&apos;m thinking about tWitch&apos;s death so we can process this together.

Please take 14 minutes to listen to this powerful message.

I share my thoughts about how to process news like this and I also emphasize something tWitch always said:

Be kind.

Today, be kind.

You never know what another person is going through, so be kind.
And always, be kind to yourself.

One thing you can do today is reach out to people you love. You never know what it’s going to mean to someone. If you don’t know what to say, you can share this episode.

And, if you are in pain right now. PLEASE. There’s a difference between wanting to end the pain you feel, and wanting to end your life.

You can end the pain with support and by taking small steps forward every single day. 

It can and it will get better.

Please, if you need help, pick up the phone. You deserve support.

Trained volunteers are standing by to help you. Call the National Suicide Hotline, which is 988 in the US. Different languages are available – click here.

Or, text HOME to 741-741 for the Crisis Text Line.

Thanks for reading this and listening to this episode. And I just wanted to end by saying, I love you and it means more than you know that you are here.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>I’ve lived with ADHD, dyslexia, and anxiety for most of my life.

And I’ve spent the last decade immersed in research around how to improve my mental health, but only recently did I realize there was a big missing piece to the puzzle when it came to being happier, more confident, and more present.

That’s taking care of the brain.

Your brain is your problem-solver.
It’s your memory keeper.
It’s a supercomputer.

If the physical health of your brain sucks, it’s like having a beer belly with IBS for a brain.

If you’re really committed to being a happier and healthier person, it&apos;s common sense to keep your brain happy and healthy. But…

The science can be complicated and boring.

More serotonin and dopamine would be great… but I zone out when I am looking at all the research.

That’s why I asked one of the leading experts on brain health to be here today. Dr. Daniel Amen has 40 years of experience as a psychiatrist, 12 New York Times bestselling books, and he’s conducted over 200,000 brain scans, all of which back up the simple tactics he’s about to share with you.

Today’s episode is jam-packed with practical information, so you may even want to listen twice. You can make your brain stronger and more resilient. There are specific changes you can make today, including supplements to take, a change to your walking style, a specific breathing technique to reduce anxiety, and more.

Dr. Amen will also share the one powerful question he’s been asking himself every single day that keeps his brain strong.

He also shares a recipe for a delicious mug of “brain healthy hot chocolate.” I’ll drink to that and a little Brain Health 101.

      <itunes:title>3 Things You Need to Accept About Other People</itunes:title>
      <itunes:author>SiriusXM Podcasts</itunes:author>
      <itunes:duration>00:51:13</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>Today you and I are digging into three things you must accept about other people. 

It took me years to understand these truths.

It sounds horrible, but I always wondered, “What’s wrong with people? Why don’t they change?”

I know you can relate. Because today I’m taking your questions about trying to change other people. 

You’re frustrated by the fact that your spouse or partner won’t exercise more. You get angry seeing how much money your daughter wastes going out every weekend. You’re annoyed by how stubborn your parents have become the older they get.

Me too.

I’ve tried every tactic you can imagine to get other people to change. And recently I realized the true source of my frustration: It’s not them, it’s me.

I’m refusing to accept three things.

These things are hard to accept, and they’re true.

Once you hear them and you apply them to your life, your relationships will be way easier.

In addition to the three truths about other people, you’ll learn research that explains why it’s so hard to get other people to change. And like all episodes, this one is packed with tactical advice and takeaways that you can put to use immediately.

And, if you’re the one who’s busy making changes but your loved ones are not being supportive, I answer that question from a listener, too.

I feel compelled to answer your questions because so many of you are improving your life with the tools you’re learning on this podcast and your family is starting to get annoyed with you. That’s okay. It shows you’re making progress (but it doesn’t make it easy).

Hopefully today’s episode will.

      <itunes:summary>Have you ever had such a powerful coincidence happen in your life that you think…

This must be a sign.

The person sitting next to you at an event turns out to be part of the team you’re interviewing with next week.

There is a hummingbird outside your apartment window on move-in day, and your grandmother always said she’d come back as one.

You’re sitting in your favorite coffee shop, thinking of someone you haven’t seen in a long time, and right at that moment, they text you.

You can’t explain how these things happen, but when they do, they give you goosebumps and make you feel just a little bit more confident and less alone.

I personally love it when this happens. And I’m always on the lookout for signs that my life is moving in the right direction.

Well, what if I told you that you can create more moments like this?

That’s what we’re talking about today.

These moments have a name: they’re called “synchronicities.”

And my guest today is Dr. Tom Myers, a professor who researched and wrote his entire Ph.D. dissertation on the subject.

You’re about to learn simple steps that will train your brain to create more of these impactful synchronicities in your own life, and three powerful reasons why it’s important that you do so.

Today, you and I are hanging out at the intersection of psychology, science, and spirituality.

Wouldn’t it be nice if your life had more of these magical moments?

Looking for signs that you’re on the right path is not some cheesy thing to do; it’s yet another way you can get intentional about training your brain to help you experience life in a whole new way.

I’ll also share a few stories from my life that are not only examples of synchronicity, but they will also give you goosebumps.

I can’t wait to hear your “goosebump” stories, and I hope what you learn from our conversation today will teach you how to create more of them.

Xo Mel 

I talk more about synchronicity, including a powerful story from my life and how to create more of them, in my New York Times bestselling book The High 5 Habit.

What is this thing we need to stop doing?

I call it the “Campaign of Misery.”  

In the background of your mind, there’s a campaign of misery running on a loop. And until you stop it, you will never experience the happiness, joy and contentment you deserve. 

I promise you - it is there. In the background - talking to you all the time. 

This is the missing piece to true happiness. 

When you remove the campaign of misery, you create room for joy.

I recorded this episode the same morning I had this profound insight.  What you&apos;re about to hear is a conversation with me and two friends and colleagues, Amy and Jessie. Pull up a seat at the kitchen table; I want you to hear me unpacking this breakthrough about happiness in real time.

My two friends saw their “campaign of misery” immediately and started describing in detail the ridiculous ways they torture themselves. You’ll laugh, you’ll nod along, and you might even cry a little. We sure did.

Because when you realize how much you rob yourself of the happiness you deserve, it is sad. 

I always say, this isn’t just a listening podcast, it’s a doing podcast. So by the end, there’s something specific I will be asking you to do with us while you listen. 

In three simple steps, you will join us as we put down the sword, grab a book of matches, and pick up the pen to write new default programming into our minds. 

Don’t worry, I’ll explain why you need matches near the end of the episode.

And you’ll be so happy that I did.

You have the power to change the way you think and the way you talk to yourself. You have the power to stop seeing all the reasons your life is hard and teach yourself to see how this could be easier. 

Yes, you can be happy.

You can be content.

But first, you have to stop making yourself miserable. Let’s support one another on this. 

If we fight this battle for happiness together, side-by-side, I am certain we will win.

      <itunes:summary>Buckle up and get ready to take notes because this episode is a masterclass.
 
The tools you’re about to learn will help you become more confident, influential, and even make more money.
 
Today, we’re talking about The “It” Factor.
 
Some people just seem to have IT, right?
 
When I think of The It Factor, people like Oprah, The Rock, Taylor Swift, the Dalai Lama, and Martin Luther King, Jr. come to mind.
 
These people make you want to lean in, join in, and learn more.
 
So today we’re asking…
 
What is “It” that some people have that makes us automatically trust and like them?
 
And, more importantly, how can you get it?
 
Here to answer that question is Vanessa Van Edwards, a best-selling author, researcher, and founder of the behavior lab The Science of People.
 
I cannot wait for you to dig into what she has researched.
 
Turns out The It Factor has another name: charisma.
 
And the good news?
 
YOU can learn how to have charisma, starting today.
 
You’re going to want to. Research finds that charismatic people are more influential, earn a higher income, and have a bigger impact at work, in their communities, and in their relationships.
 
The secret to hacking it? Social cues, like body language and the way you speak.
 
That’s why today’s episode is a masterclass.
 
You’ll learn… 
Shocking research from Princeton about how people size you up
3 things you must do in the first 10 seconds of a Zoom call
Tips for nailing an interview
The major mistake you’re making as you speak
How to ask for a raise
A simple test that will help you figure out how charismatic you are
Why you never want to fake a smile
Tips for charisma for introverts
Why a second impression is as important as the first
 
That’s just the tip of the iceberg. Today’s episode is jam-packed with simple, tactical research and tools that will help you and anyone you care about develop the skill of charisma.
 
And you deserve that.

      <itunes:summary>Whatever you&apos;re doing right now, stop and make time for this conversation.
 
Every single day, I get questions from listeners about self-love, self-hatred, and what it actually means to like yourself.
 
I understand why it’s confusing. 
 
The topic of self-love is so broad, and there is very little actionable advice on how exactly you learn to like yourself, especially if you’ve spent your whole life being hard on yourself.
 
So don’t worry, I’ve decided to attack this topic of self-love in a completely unique, surprising, and tactical manner. This is also one of the most personal episodes I’ve released because I’m inviting you to join a conversation I’m having with our 17-year-old son, Oakley.
 
This is not a “podcast interview.” This is an intimate conversation between a mother and a son about the most important topic you could discuss: self-love. 
 
When Oakley was in middle school, he hated himself, and as his mom, it was awful to see him so lonely and sad. In today’s conversation, he shares things with me about this time in his life that I never knew.
 
And more importantly, we unpack the moment he had an epiphany that changed everything.
 
You will absolutely relate to everything he shares and his reflections about it.
 
I’m so proud to share this conversation with you. You will be blown away because you’ll not only feel like you’re part of our family, but we’re also welcoming you into our hearts.
 
You will laugh out loud, even though your heart might break a little. And by the end of it, you’ll have not only wisdom, but also a couple of simple tools to help you learn how to like yourself a little more.
 
This conversation is a must-listen for EVERYONE in your life. And especially for young adults because when they hear these insights from someone their age, it’s way more compelling than getting advice from an adult.
 
I do want to be up front about one thing: Oakley is 17 and like most 17-year-olds, whether they do it in front of you or not, he has a case of the F’s, meaning he drops the F-word a fair number of times, and I made a decision to record it as is and allow him to speak freely.
 
And, I just can’t emphasize enough how much insight this is going to give you into your own relationship with yourself.
 
I hope you will make the time to spend a half hour with the two of us, because I know you will leave feeling seen, understood, and liking yourself a little better.
 
I cannot wait to hear what you learn.

This conversation is a must-listen for EVERYONE in your life. And especially for young adults because when they hear these insights from someone their age, it’s way more compelling than getting advice from an adult.
 
I do want to be up front about one thing: Oakley is 17 and like most 17-year-olds, whether they do it in front of you or not, he has a case of the F’s, meaning he drops the F-word a fair number of times, and I made a decision to record it as is and allow him to speak freely.
 
And, I just can’t emphasize enough how much insight this is going to give you into your own relationship with yourself.
 
I hope you will make the time to spend a half hour with the two of us, because I know you will leave feeling seen, understood, and liking yourself a little better.
 
I cannot wait to hear what you learn.

      <itunes:summary>I want you to get serious about inserting fun back into the holidays this year.
 
It might seem odd to have an entire conversation about fun. But here’s why we have to: most of us aren’t having any.
 
In fact, it’s gotten so bad that researchers have a term for it: “a fun drought.” You’re not alone – 97% of people want to have more fun.
 
And wouldn’t it be fabulous if you had an absolute blast with your family this holiday season?
 
It is possible. And you’re just the person to make it happen.
 
On the topic of family, I find it interesting that most of the advice out there is focused on toxic family dynamics and boundaries. If your family is that toxic, the only thing you need to do is make other plans. You’re not required to spend time with them.
 
But… if you are planning to spend time with family during the holidays, make this the year you bring the fun.
 
Fun breaks up old dynamics, fun draws people out of their shells, and fun gives you something to talk about other than the weather and how the school year is going.
 
And laughter is not only great medicine, but it also makes you happier and strengthens your relationships with those you’re having fun with!
 
Today you and I are getting serious about fun.
 
In this episode, you’re going to learn the 3 things that get in the way of you having fun – the biggest one being that you don’t plan for it.
 
So, we are going to discuss how to plan for and have more fun, and I’ll give you all kinds of ideas to consider.
 
This is the perfect episode to listen to with your family if you’re traveling. It’s appropriate for all ages.
 
So shake off the dread and pull out the party hats. I’m on a mission to inspire you to have more fun.

      <itunes:summary>What if you could show up in any relationship feeling secure, exactly as you are?
 
You didn’t have to overthink every text you sent. 
 
You wouldn’t have to play the dating games.
 
If somebody ghosted you, it wouldn’t be the end of the world. 
 
Well I’m here to tell you today that you CAN be that person. 
 
Meet the phenomenal Dr. Marisa Franco, New York Times bestselling author of “Platonic” and expert on attachment theory.
 
Today, we’re shining a light on your attachment style.
 
What is an attachment style?
 
Simple. It’s a framework backed by decades of research that will help you understand how you show up in relationships.
 
There are 4 attachment styles, and whether you’re aware of it or not, you default to one of them.
 
If you have a hard time setting boundaries with family members…
 
If you keep dating the same kind of people… 
 
If you cling to relationships that have long expired…
 
Or if you’ve never been able to connect with someone on a deeply emotional level.
 
Blame your attachment style.
 
And here’s the good news: when you understand attachment theory, you can change your default attachment style and become more secure, which leads to happier and healthier relationships.
 
You deserve that, which is why this episode is for you.
 
Today, Dr. Franco breaks down the 4 attachment styles that make or break your relationships, AND the powerful tools you can use to improve them. 
 
Once you understand your attachment style, you’ll have a lens through which to improve absolutely every relationship, especially the one you have with yourself. 
 
Because at the deepest level, becoming more secure is about allowing love in.

      <itunes:summary>A survival guide to adult friendship: how to find your people, have more fun, and create meaningful friendships as an adult.
 
This is the topic you and everyone else are thinking about.
 
From making new friends to staying connected to your old ones, to the thing that’s really hard: what do you do when your friendships start to fade?
 
This is something I’ve been dying to talk to you about because I am right here, shoulder to shoulder with you, feeling lonely, left out, and wondering…
Where did all my friends go?
 
I know I’m not the only one because when I do see my friends or meet someone new, everyone is talking about how they never see their friends anymore.
 
Let’s fix that.
 
I spent a lot of time reflecting on the things that I’m doing that keep me from putting myself out there (which I know I need to do) and did extensive research on the topic.
 
What I discovered is both comforting and empowering. I can’t wait to share it with you.
 
I can boil all of this research down to the 5 lies you and I tell ourselves about friendship.
 
These lies are keeping you from having the best relationships of your life.
 
That’s why you need to hear them.
 
So did I.
 
You also need to hear the truth bombs I’m dropping and the smarty pants research I found to back it all up.
 
Because once you stop repeating these lies, your life will open up again.
 
You’ll have an easier time finding, making, and strengthening your relationships with friends. 
 
And most importantly, your friendships will align with who you really are and what you really want in this chapter of your life.
 
Today it’s just you and me, friend to friend, figuring sh*t out together.
 
So let’s go.

We are going to blow the lid off of emotional triggers.

Let’s get to the bottom of why you and I react the way we do, and more importantly, learn simple ways to take control of our emotions.

It doesn’t matter where you live, how you grew up, or even if you’re a freakin’ saint to everyone else, I know you have something that triggers you.

You have days just like I do when something sets you off and you either snap like a firecracker or withdraw like a turtle in a shell.

And just like me, you say and do things you later regret.

I’ll go first: I’m trying hard to work on the nasty tone of voice I use with Chris and our kids when I feel frustrated or confronted.

And it doesn’t end there. If you’re like me, you beat yourself up for getting triggered, and you now start feeling bad and regret what you did (or the fact that you did nothing).

It makes me feel like crap when I do these things. I have felt helpless for a long time because it’s been so automatic when I get triggered emotionally. 

I don’t want to keep living like this. I’d like to feel calm, peaceful, and more in control.

And that’s what this episode is about. 

Wouldn’t you love to get out of this cycle of feeling emotionally triggered? Wouldn’t you love to take control of your emotional life as an adult?

The good news: you can rewire your response to stressful and annoying situations.

And in turn, you’ll bring more happiness, presence, control, and closer relationships into your life, because you’ll be present in them instead of letting your emotions drive you. 

So, who is going to teach us about triggers?

I’ve tracked down a psychologist who teaches one of the most popular online workshops about this topic:

The incredible Dr. Becky Kennedy.

She’s the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Good Inside. And do not let the fact that she is a child psychologist and parenting expert keep you from soaking up and applying everything you can learn from her.

No matter how old you are right now, YOU were once a child. And that, my friend, is where your triggers got hardwired inside of you: before you even knew how to talk.

Understanding triggers (and taming them) requires you to go back before you can move forward.

Dr. Becky says, “Your triggers are stories from your past.”

Listen to this episode and really try to absorb what Dr. Becky shares, because the wiring and triggers that frustrate you right now are not permanent.

I know you’re going to send this to every one of your friends who is a parent, and please send it to your kids, nieces, and nephews, too. 

Learning how to rewire my response to stress at 54 is amazing. But imagine if you knew how to do this in high school. That’s why I’ve asked our three kids – ages 23, 22, and 17 – to listen too. Sure, it would be nice for us to pass this healing and confidence-building stuff down to every generation, right? If they get this information now, they can rewire themselves faster.

This is really important, life-changing stuff. And I love that it’s also so simple. And you know what else I love? You. Thank you for listening and let me know what you learn.

      <itunes:summary>You know those days when you just feel “off”? Well, last week, both my friend Amy and I were having bad days.

Thankfully, I had just had an appointment with my amazing therapist that morning.

So, as Amy and I started to talk about why we didn’t “feel like ourselves,” I got this crazy idea that maybe we should invite YOU to join us as the conversation started to unfold.

We decided to turn on a recording device and unpack how we were feeling – on the fly.

I need to say: I stole everything you’re about to hear from my therapist Anne, and you should steal it too.

This is way more than just learning how to put on a happy face.

These tools are truly transformational because they help you tap back into the incredible power within you.

This is a very intimate and special episode that unfolds live.

So I’m inviting you right now: pull up a seat at the kitchen table with Amy and me.

Join us. Don’t just listen, but close your eyes and do the exercises with us.

Do not miss out on what happens near the end. It is magical and I certainly did not see it coming.

And I know you’re going to want to see the cowboy boots: don’t worry, they are in the show notes on my website here.

      <itunes:summary>Narcissism is on the rise and you need to learn how to spot it in other people and have tools to protect yourself.

We all know those people who constantly turn a conversation toward themselves, who only call you when they want something, and who have a way of making everything someone else’s fault.

Well, guess what? Turns out narcissism goes far beyond that.

I’m telling you right now, even if you THINK you know what a narcissist is, you need to listen.

I thought I knew, yet I’m still reeling from all my breakthrough moments.

Do you have a narcissist in your life?

Maybe you grew up with one.

Maybe you work with one.

Maybe you married one.

Maybe you don’t know what the hell a narcissist is!

Pull up a seat at the table with me because class is IN session.

Narcissism is a term that gets thrown around a lot these days, so how do you know if you’re *really* dealing with a narcissist?

You have been blowing up my email and DMs about this topic, so Dr. Ramani Durvasula is here to answer your questions.

She’s the world’s leading expert on narcissism and someone I’ve followed and admired for years. I love how she breaks down the topic of narcissism in a way that’s understandable, simple, and packed with tools you can apply the second you learn them.

Listen in as she shines a light on the REAL definition of a narcissist and the 5 warning signs you need to know if you’re dealing with one.

This topic is so juicy – and so surprising – that you’re going to be shocked by what you learn. One part in particular will change how you approach narcissists in your life from this day forward.

That’s exactly what happened to me. I have somebody in my life, a very prominent somebody, who absolutely displays narcissistic tendencies, and I have spent years in therapy dealing with it. So I actually got out of my chair and hugged Dr. Ramani after everything she taught me and you in this amazing episode!

If you get something out of this episode, or if you have a friend that has struggled with a narcissist in their life, please share this with them.

And if you think a person is a narcissist, don&apos;t even bother sharing, because if there&apos;s one thing you&apos;re going to learn: you don&apos;t want to EVER call one out…

That&apos;s just one of the many rules you&apos;re going to learn to follow in order to protect yourself from narcissistic behavior.

This episode is jam-packed with teachable moments that will leave you seeing the narcissists in your life with 20-20 insight.

You’ll learn how to not only deal with them but also end this episode with the tools to heal.

And that, my friend, could be the takeaway that changes your life forever.

      <itunes:summary>How do you know if the thing you’re holding on to is something you should keep fighting for or if it’s time to let go? 
 
Phenomenal question. I’ve got the answer. 
 
The truth is, most of us never let go. 
 
You spend a lot of time adding things into your life – new projects, new relationships, new stuff – but when was the last time you *subtracted* something?
 
I’m talking about all the things you hang on to, even when they’re no longer serving you or helping you grow.
 
The stuff that you know is weighing you down and sucking your energy dry, but you can’t seem to drop it. 
 
I’ve got the solution for you.
 
I’m about to walk you – literally – through a strategy that nobody talks about. It will help you let go of what’s a pain or a drain in your life. 
 
Are you staying in a job you hate?
 
Do you keep hanging out with that friend who brings you down?
 
Holding on to those too-small pants because you’re hoping to one day fit into them again?
 
As the late, great Pulitzer and Nobel prize winner Toni Morrison wrote, if you “want to fly, you got to give up the shit that weighs you down.”
 
By the end of this episode, you’ll understand how to start letting go of what doesn’t serve you to create room for growth.
 
And, you’ll learn the two things you must let go of today.
 
Get ready to step into your new potential and unlock the magic of your life.
 
Aren’t you ready for that? I know I am. Let’s do it!

      <itunes:summary>Everything you think about anxiety is wrong.
 
Yes, we’re starting there.
 
And yes, we’re going deep.
 
I know that this episode will change your life. It has done the same for mine.
 
It’s not a secret that I’ve struggled with anxiety for pretty much my whole life. I swear I came out of the womb in a full-blown panic attack, and I was just warming up for a life of worry on a very elite, professional level.
 
I have been sharing my anxiety journey, and the tools that have helped me, for the past five years. 
 
And in this episode, things go deeper than they have ever have before.
 
No exaggeration when I say that my takeaway from this interview today is so revolutionary, it’s forever changed the way I think about my anxiety and my relationship to it.
 
Which is why it’s my honor to introduce you to Dr. Russell Kennedy, MD.
 
I’m willing to bet that what you learn today you haven’t heard yet.
 
Like the real reason you’re anxious in the first place.
 
It’s not what you’re thinking.
 
No lie, I’ve been stalking Dr. Kennedy on Instagram for the past year because I just love his stuff. 
 
Like me, he’s lived with his own anxiety since childhood. As a neuroscientist and a medical doctor, he also has the clinical experience to teach us how to HEAL our anxiety.
 
Did you catch that?
 
You don’t have to stop at managing your anxiety; you can actually heal it. 
 
I see you if you’re living with a constant “nervous stomach.”
 
I see you if you can’t sleep. 
 
I see you if your heart races and your muscles are often tense.
 
What Dr. Kennedy shares with you today has changed my relationship to anxiety, and I know it can do the same for you. 
 
It will blow your mind when Dr. Kennedy tells you that we’ve been attacking this all wrong, and he’ll give you simple science and research-backed tools that will change your life immediately! 
 
I ask all the questions you are thinking about anxiety and Dr. Kennedy and I get real with the answers.
 
You are not only going to learn how to deal with your anxiety in a very simple but effective way, you are going to learn why it’s there, what it’s trying to tell you, and how to heal it for good. 
 
This episode has changed my life and I know it will do the same for you and your loved ones. Bookmark this episode and share it with those in your life who need it.
 
It’s time. You deserve what you’re about to learn.

      <itunes:summary>The biggest secret to getting the life you want is understanding 3 words I hope you never forget:
 
Motivation. Is. Garbage.
 
Right now, think about something you want to change or improve.
 
I bet you know WHAT you want to change – and what you need to do.
 
But the 100 million dollar question is: HOW?
 
How do you get started? 
 
And how do you keep going even when you don’t feel like it?
 
Look, if change was easy, we’d all have six-pack abs, a million dollars in the bank, and healed our trauma.
 
And that’s where this episode comes in: I teach you the HOW.
 
I cracked the code on motivation, and in the next hour, I’m sharing everything I know with you. 
 
You’ll learn the secret to breaking old habits, creating new ones, and how to hack what neuroscientists call “activation energy.”
 
You’ll also learn one simple but incredible tool, that’s grounded in decades of research, and will change your life forever. This tool is a “cheat code” for motivation. It’s worked for millions of people and it will for you, too.
 
I wish that what I was about to tell you was something I had read in a book, but unfortunately, that&apos;s not how I tend to learn things.
 
I&apos;m the kind of person who either has to fall into a hole that I didn&apos;t see to learn a lesson, or more likely, I screw up my life so badly, I dig the hole for myself. 
 
This was me back in 2008. I was digging the biggest life hole ever. And that’s where this episode begins. 
 
I was at the lowest point in my life. My husband’s business was failing, I was unemployed, on the brink of bankruptcy and divorce, I was drinking way too much, and to top it all off, I couldn’t even get up in the morning. Not the Mel Robbins you know today.
 
This is the exact moment I discovered the secret to hacking motivation – because I had to if I wanted to fix my own life. 
 
And if I can do it, you can too.
 
If you&apos;re a new listener, you&apos;ll learn more about how I got to where I am today. 
 
And if you&apos;ve been a fan for a while, this episode will be a reminder of the power within you to make any change you can imagine.
 
At the end of the episode, I’ll also give you a free 5-day challenge – The Wake Up Challenge – to walk you through getting started with these tools: www.melrobbins.com/wakeup
 
You won’t believe how simple it is to transform your life, your work, and your attitude. I can’t wait to show you how.
